AB  - Triage is a process of accessing patients on their severity based on a triage acuity scale in hospital emergency department (ED). Re-triage is a process where the severity of a patient's condition is reassessed when there is a clinical need for it. Re-triage does not feature in the conventional triage, where the patients with non-urgent consideration will have to wait to be treated on a first come first serve basis. In this study, we investigate the effect of re-triage on patients waiting time and on the ED service by means of agent-based modelling and simulation. The simulation is based on historical records of patients presenting to the ED of Hospital USM in the year 2011. The result of the simulation shows that the implementation of re-triage in the conventional three-level triage system can significantly Reduce the waiting time of patients with deteriorating clinical conditions, with slight increase in the demand for ED service due to the re-triage activity. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Emergency Department (ED) crowding has become an issue of delayed patient treatment and even a public healthcare problem around the world. According to recent research studies of many countries, the increasing number of patients in the emergency department which has led to unprecedented crowding and delays in care. For that reason, triage into five-level Emergency Severity Index (ESI) has become a major method for improving medical priorities in ED. Although the ESI mitigates the process of ED treatment, so far it still heavily relies on the nurse's subjective judgment and is easy to triage most patients to ESI level 3 in current practice. Therefore, a system that can help the doctors to accurately triage a patient's condition is imperative. In this work, we propose a system based on the patients' ED electronic health record to predict hospitalizations after assigned procedures in ED are completed. While most of the related studies have employed traditional machine learning for triage-related classification and highly relied on a feature selection process, our proposed system used data-to-image transform to produce the input and a convolutional neural network as a classifier. For validation, the data from an open dataset (National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey) is used which includes 118,602 patient visits of United States EDs from 2012 to 2016 survey years. To sum up, the resulting AUROC and accuracy achieve 0.86 and 0.77, respectively, in our work.

AB  - Overcrowding in the Emergency Department (ED) has become one of the most severe healthcare issues worldwide. A number of researchers have reported that many countries, including Taiwan, have a significant and noticeable increase in ED visits. This phenomenon, overcrowding in the ED, has caused several adverse effects not only on patients but also on the healthcare delivery process, quality of care, and care efficiency. However, the currently adopted five-level triage system, Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale (TTAS), is insufficient to distinguish patients' conditions into different priorities. Therefore, a system that could help to triage a patients' conditions accurately is demanded. While most of the existing studies have only utilized retrospective data and used traditional machine learning as the approaches, which might not satisfy for clinical decisions and real-world situations, this paper proposed an interpretable novel triage prediction system for predicting hospitalization based on prospectively collected data in the emergency department, including vital signs and chief complaints. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated on our own collected data in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), with 73 samples needing hospital admission and 73 samples discharged. Ten times of 10-fold cross-validation were done to evaluate the performance of our proposed model, a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean accuracy are achieved at 0.836 and 0.805, respectively.

AB  - Emergency department is the frontline and critical service of a hospital which provides wide ranges of medical services which includes diagnostic, resuscitation and stabilization components to save life. Triage is a process that assists assistant medical officer to justify condition of patient and arrange appropriate treatment for them. According to The Policy of Emergency Medicine and Trauma Service of Malaysia, all patients who accessing to any treatment in emergency department shall proceed to triage. However, the ongoing crowding of emergency department has led to calls for improvement of triage system to facilitate effectiveness of this process. To overcome this problem, a computerized triage system known as Automated Triage System was developed to perform triage within time limitation for each patient and consistent triage decision. Automated triage system could improve quality of service and reduce costs due to misappropriate of resources. The developed system consists of biomedical modules, graphical user interface (GUI) using Microsoft Visual Studio and triage decision making algorithm. This system acquires vital signs, syndrome and chief complaint from patient. The acquired data will be analyzed using triage decision making algorithm and triage level of a patient will be reported instantly. All information and patient records will be stored in database for future reference. Finally, an automated triage system has been designed and developed to assists assistant medical officer to perform triage assessment in Emergency Room. This system can provide accurate and specific triage output compared to the one done by assistant medical officer. The average time taken to perform the triage assessment using this system is around 6 minutes.

AB  - Overcrowding in Emergency Departments (ED) is considered as an international issue, which could have adverse impacts on multiple care outcomes such as the length of stay for example. Part of the solution could lie in the early prediction of the patient outcome as discharge or hospitalization. This study applies Deep Learning to this end. A large-scale dataset of about 260K ED records was provided by the Amiens-Picardy University Hospital in France. In general, our approach is based on integrating structured data with unstructured textual notes recorded at the triage stage. The key idea is to apply a multi-input of mixed data for training a classification model to predict hospitalization. In a simultaneous manner, the model training utilizes the numeric features along with textual data. On one hand, a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is used with the standard set of features (i.e. numeric and categorical). On the other hand, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to operate over the textual data. The two components of learning are conducted independently in parallel. The empirical results demonstrated that the classifier could achieve a very good accuracy with ROC-AUC≈0.83. The study is conceived to contribute to the mounting efforts of applying Natural Language Processing in the healthcare domain.

The study uses a large-scale dataset including more than 260K ED records provided by the Amiens-Picardy University Hospital in France. Our approach aims to integrate structured data with unstructured textual notes recorded at the triage stage. On one hand, a standard MLP model is used against the typical set of features. On the other hand, a Convolutional Neural Network is used to operate over the textual data. While both learning components are conducted independently in parallel. The empirical results demonstrated a promising accuracy in general. It is conceived that the study could be an additional contribution to the mounting efforts of applying NLP methods in the healthcare domain.

AB  - The paper describes design and implementation of a mobile clinical triage support system for the evaluation of acute appendicitis in childhood. The MET (Mobile Emergency Triage) system was developed according to the general principles of client-server architecture, with mobile clients running on Palm handhelds. Decision model implemented in MET follows the principles of evidence-based medicine based on retrospective data. We applied a hybrid methodological approach involving fuzzy measures and rough set theory to develop this model. In a randomized retrospective trial, the triage recommendation of the MET system had a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 85.7%. MET is a fully functional mobile clinical triage support system that provides triage recommendation at the point of care, irrespective of the completeness of the clinical information. It also allows for data capture and interaction with the hospital's information system. Given mobility of MET and its easy-to-use features, we are proposing a system that can both support evidence-based emergency room patient care, and at the same time, streamline the bedside triage of a child with abdominal pain.

AB  - The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision has strongly recommended that all hospitals need to take action to improve the long waiting times before patients are seen by a physician in the Hospital Emergency Department. Akershus University Hospital has complied with this by introducing physician triage every weekday from 10am to 7pm. Because it is difficult to see the influence this has had on the patient flow in the ED, the Hospital Research Department has developed two simulation models to estimate the effect on patient waiting time by replacing nurse triage with that of a physician. The results of the simulations show that the waiting time for an initial physician evaluation was reduced from 117 minutes to 26 minutes, while the waiting time for a physician examination was reduced only by 7 minutes. The total waiting time in the ED was reduced from 297 to 288 minutes when introducing physician triage. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: This paper presents a deep learning method of predicting where in a hospital emergency patients will be admitted after being triaged in the Emergency Department (ED). Such a prediction will allow for the preparation of bed space in the hospital for timely care and admission of the patient as well as allocation of resource to the relevant departments, including during periods of increased demand arising from seasonal peaks in infections. Methods: The problem is posed as a multi-class classification into seven separate ward types. A novel deep learning training strategy was created that combines learning via curriculum and a multi-armed bandit to exploit this curriculum post-initial training. Results: We successfully predict the initial hospital admission location with area-under-receiver-operating-curve (AUROC) ranging between 0.60 to 0.78 for the individual wards and an overall maximum accuracy of 52% where chance corresponds to 14% for this seven-class setting. Our proposed network was able to interpret which features drove the predictions using a 'network saliency' term added to the network loss function. Conclusion: We have proven that prediction of location of admission in hospital for emergency patients is possible using information from triage in ED. We have also shown that there are certain tell-tale tests which indicate what space of the hospital a patient will use. Significance: It is hoped that this predictor will be of value to healthcare institutions by allowing for the planning of resource and bed space ahead of the need for it. This in turn should speed up the provision of care for the patient and allow flow of patients out of the ED thereby improving patient flow and the quality of care for the remaining patients within the ED.

AB  - Crowding within emergency departments (EDs) can have significant negative consequences for patients. EDs therefore need to explore the use of innovative methods to improve patient flow and prevent overcrowding. One potential method is the use of data mining using machine learning techniques to predict ED admissions. This paper uses routinely collected administrative data (120 600 records) from two major acute hospitals in Northern Ireland to compare contrasting machine learning algorithms in predicting the risk of admission from the ED. We use three algorithms to build the predictive models: 1) logistic regression; 2) decision trees; and 3) gradient boosted machines (GBM). The GBM performed better (accuracy = 80.31%, AUC-ROC = 0.859) than the decision tree (accuracy = 80.06%, AUC-ROC = 0.824) and the logistic regression model (accuracy = 79.94%, AUC-ROC = 0.849). Drawing on logistic regression, we identify several factors related to hospital admissions, including hospital site, age, arrival mode, triage category, care group, previous admission in the past month, and previous admission in the past year. This paper highlights the potential utility of three common machine learning algorithms in predicting patient admissions. Practical implementation of the models developed in this paper in decision support tools would provide a snapshot of predicted admissions from the ED at a given time, allowing for advance resource planning and the avoidance bottlenecks in patient flow, as well as comparison of predicted and actual admission rates. When interpretability is a key consideration, EDs should consider adopting logistic regression models, although GBM's will be useful where accuracy is paramount.

AB  - Primary care doctoring in the USA today (2007) bears little resemblance to what existed just 25 years ago. We focus on what is likely to unfold in the U.S. over the next several decades and suggest that by about 2025, primary care doctoring in the U.S. could be rare, possibly unrecognizable and even nonexistent. Seven reasons for the probable disappearance of primary care doctoring are identified. The most important reason is medicine's loss of state sponsorship: the U.S. state has shifted from a pluralistic orientation to a New Right approach. With less state protection medicine has become even more attractive for private interests. Six additional reasons include: (1) the epidemiologic transition (chronic diseases reduce doctors to a palliative role and monitoring of incurable conditions); (2) the overcrowded health care playing field (non-physician clinicians are supplanting primary care doctors); (3) the unintended consequences of clinical guidelines (the art of doctoring is reduced to formulaic tasks, easily codified and performed by non-physician clinicians); (4) the demise of the in-person examination (in-person examination is being replaced by impersonal testing); (5) primary care doctoring is becoming unattractive (physicians are dissatisfied, alienated and experiencing income declines. Applications by U.S. graduates to primary care programs continue to decline); (6) patients are not what they used to be (Internet access and Direct to Consumer advertising are changing the doctor-patient relationship). By 2025, many everyday illnesses in the U.S. will be managed via the Internet or by non-physician clinicians working out of retail clinics. Some medical problems will still require a physician's attention, but this will be provided by specialists rather than by primary care doctors (general practitioners). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Callard and Perego depict long Covid as the first illness to be defined by patients who came together on social media. Responding to their call to address why patients were so effective in making long Covid visible and igniting action to improve its care, we use narrative inquiry – a field of research that investigates the place and power of stories and storytelling. We analyse a large dataset of narrative interviews and focus groups with 114 people with long Covid (45 of whom were healthcare professionals) from the United Kingdom, drawing on socio-narratology (Frank), therapeutic emplotment (Mattingly) and polyphonia (Bakhtin). We describe how storytelling devices including chronology, metaphor, characterisation, suspense and imagination were used to create persuasive accounts of a strange and frightening new condition that was beset with setbacks and overlooked or dismissed by health professionals. The most unique feature of long Covid narratives (in most but not all cases) was the absence, for various pandemic-related reasons, of a professional witness to them. Instead of sharing their narratives in therapeutic dialogue with their own clinician, people struggled with a fragmented inner monologue before finding an empathetic audience and other resonant narratives in the online community. Individually, the stories seemed to make little sense. Collectively, they provided a rich description of the diverse manifestations of a grave new illness, a shared account of rejection by the healthcare system, and a powerful call for action to fix the broken story. Evolving from individual narrative postings to collective narrative drama, long Covid communities challenged the prevailing model of Covid-19 as a short-lived respiratory illness which invariably delivers a classic triad of symptoms; undertook and published peer-reviewed research to substantiate its diverse and protracted manifestations; and gained positions as experts by experience on guideline development groups and policy taskforces.

The links between the university and clinical assessments were instrumental in developing both midwifery and specialised skills required for extending their scope of practice. The changing demographics of their client group facilitated the need to provide safe assessment and management of ladies with complex health and social needs in pregnancy and childbirth; provide specialised clinics and the development of a robust stafftraining and assessment process. The generic competencies they gained improved collaborative working with their medical colleagues, raising the trainees profile and acceptance of their extended role. In addition to this, development of specialised midwifery skills promoted a high degree of decision making responsibilities within midwifery to facilitate service development and promote evidence based care.

AB  - Process mining is the research domain focusing on the development of innovative methods to gather insights from event logs. It has been used for various use cases within the healthcare domain with the ambition to instigate evidence-based process improvement. Over the past years, the research interest in process mining in healthcare has been increasing. This paper presents the results of an extensive systematic literature review on process mining in healthcare in which 263 papers have been reviewed. Besides providing the most recent overview of literature and the extensive number of reviewed papers, we complement existing reviews by considering three novel review dimensions: (i) the process mining project stages, (ii) the involvement of domain expertise, and (iii) the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) considered during the process mining analysis. Orthogonal to these three novel dimensions, we also highlight the evolution of the research domain by considering time trends within the review dimensions. The review generates new perspectives on process mining in healthcare as a research domain. For instance, process redesign is rarely part of a process mining project, domain experts are mostly asked for validating insights, and less than half of the published papers considers one or more specific KPIs to direct their analysis.

AB  - Background Emergency departments have become overcrowded with increased waiting times. Strategies to decrease waiting times include time-based key performance indicators and introduction of a waiting room nurse role. The aim of the waiting room nurse role is to expedite care by assessing and managing patients in the waiting room. There is limited literature examining this role. Methods This paper presents results of semi-structured interviews with five key informants to explore why and how the waiting room nurse role was implemented in Australian emergency departments. Data were thematically analysed. Results Five key informants from five emergency departments across two Australian jurisdictions (Victoria and New South Wales) reported that the role was introduced to reduce waiting times and improve quality and safety of care in the ED waiting room. Critical to introducing the role was defining and supporting the scope of practice, experience and preparation of the nurses. Role implementation required champions to overcome identified challenges, including funding. There has been limited evaluation of the role. Conclusions The waiting room nurse role was introduced to decrease waiting times and contributed to risk mitigation. Common to all roles was standing orders, while preparation and experience varied. Further research into the role is required.

AB  - Study objective: Topic identification can facilitate knowledge curation, discover thematic relationships, trends, and predict future direction. We aimed to determine through an unsupervised, machine learning approach to topic modeling the most common research themes in emergency medicine over the last 40 years and summarize their trends and characteristics. Methods: We retrieved the complete reference entries including article abstracts from Ovid for all original research articles from 1980 to 2019 within emergency medicine for six widely-cited journals. Abstracts were processed through a natural language pipeline and analyzed by a latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling algorithm for unsupervised topic discovery. Topics were further examined through trend analysis, word associations, co-occurrence metrics, and two-dimensional embeddings. Results: We retrieved 47,158 articles during the defined time period that were filtered to 20,528 articles for further analysis. Forty topics covering methodologic and clinical areas were discovered. These topics separated into distinct clusters when embedded in two-dimensional space and exhibited consistent patterns of interaction. We observed the greatest increase in popularity in research themes involving risk factors (0.4% to 5.2%), health utilization (1.2% to 5.0%), and ultrasound (0.7% to 3.3%), and a relative decline in research involving basic science (8.9% to 1.1%), cardiac arrest (6.5% to 2.2%), and vitals (6.3% to 1.3%) over the past 40 years. Our data show only very modest growth in mental health and substance abuse research (1.0% to 1.6%), despite ongoing crises. Conclusions: Topic modeling via unsupervised machine learning applied to emergency medicine abstracts discovered coherent topics, trends, and patterns of interaction.

AB  - Background: The key aim of triage in chest pain patients is to identify those with high risk of adverse cardiac events as they require intensive monitoring and early intervention. In this study, we aim to discover the most relevant variables for risk prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) using clinical signs and heart rate variability.
Methods. A total of 702 chest pain patients at the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary hospital in Singapore were included in this study. The recruited patients were at least 30 years of age and who presented to the ED with a primary complaint of non-traumatic chest pain. The primary outcome was a composite of MACE such as death and cardiac arrest within 72 h of arrival at the ED. For each patient, eight clinical signs such as blood pressure and temperature were measured, and a 5-min ECG was recorded to derive heart rate variability parameters. A random forest-based novel method was developed to select the most relevant variables. A geometric distance-based machine learning scoring system was then implemented to derive a risk score from 0 to 100.
Results: Out of 702 patients, 29 (4.1%) met the primary outcome. We selected the 3 most relevant variables for predicting MACE, which were systolic blood pressure, the mean RR interval and the mean instantaneous heart rate. The scoring system with these 3 variables produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.812, and a cutoff score of 43 gave a sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 63.4%, while the scoring system with all the 23 variables had an AUC of 0.736, and a cutoff score of 49 gave a sensitivity of 72.4% and specificity of 63.0%. Conventional thrombolysis in myocardial infarction score and the modified early warning score achieved AUC values of 0.637 and 0.622, respectively.
Conclusions: It is observed that a few predictors outperformed the whole set of variables in predicting MACE within 72 h. We conclude that more predictors do not necessarily guarantee better prediction results. Furthermore, machine learning-based variable selection seems promising in discovering a few relevant and significant measures as predictors.

AB  - Syndromic surveillance detects and monitors individual and population health indicators through sources such as emergency department records. Automated classification of these records can improve outbreak detection speed and diagnosis accuracy. Current syndromic systems rely on hand-coded keyword-based methods to parse written fields and may benefit from the use of modern supervised-learning classifier models. In this paper, we implement two recurrent neural network models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) cells and compare them to two traditional bag-of-words classifiers: multinomial naïve Bayes (MNB) and a support vector machine (SVM). The MNB classifier is one of only two machine learning algorithms currently being used for syndromic surveillance. All four models are trained to predict diagnostic code groups as defined by Clinical Classification Software, first to predict from discharge diagnosis, and then from chief complaint fields. The classifiers are trained on 3.6 million de-identified emergency department records from a single United States jurisdiction. We compare performance of these models primarily using the F 1 score, and we measure absolute model performance to determine which conditions are the most amenable to surveillance based on chief complaint alone. Using discharge diagnoses, the LSTM classifier performs best, though all models exhibit an F 1 score above 96.00. Using chief complaints, the GRU performs best (F 1 = 47.38), and MNB with bigrams performs worst (F 1 = 39.40). We also note that certain syndrome types are easier to detect than others. For example, chief complaints using the GRU model predicts alcohol-related disorders well (F 1 = 78.91) but predicts influenza poorly (F 1 = 14.80). In all instances, the RNN models outperformed the bag-of-words classifiers suggesting deep learning models could substantially improve the automatic classification of unstructured text for syndromic surveillance.

AB  - Objective: Early identification of emergency department (ED) patients who need hospitalization is essential for quality of care and patient safety. We aimed to compare machine learning (ML) models predicting the hospitalization of ED patients and conventional regression techniques at three points in time after ED registration. Methods: We analyzed consecutive ED patients of three hospitals using the Netherlands Emergency Department Evaluation Database (NEED). We developed prediction models for hospitalization using an increasing number of data available at triage, ∼30 min (including vital signs) and ∼2 h (including laboratory tests) after ED registration, using ML (random forest, gradient boosted decision trees, deep neural networks) and multivariable logistic regression analysis (including spline transformations for continuous predictors). Demographics, urgency, presenting complaints, disease severity and proxies for comorbidity, and complexity were used as covariates. We compared the performance using the area under the ROC curve in independent validation sets from each hospital. Results: We included 172,104 ED patients of whom 66,782 (39 %) were hospitalized. The AUC of the multivariable logistic regression model was 0.82 (0.78−0.86) at triage, 0.84 (0.81−0.86) at ∼30 min and 0.83 (0.75−0.92) after ∼2 h. The best performing ML model over time was the gradient boosted decision trees model with an AUC of 0.84 (0.77−0.88) at triage, 0.86 (0.82−0.89) at ∼30 min and 0.86 (0.74−0.93) after ∼2 h. Conclusions: Our study showed that machine learning models had an excellent but similar predictive performance as the logistic regression model for predicting hospital admission. In comparison to the 30-min model, the 2-h model did not show a performance improvement. After further validation, these prediction models could support management decisions by real-time feedback to medical personal.

AB  - Objective: Pre-hospital emergency medical services use clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to triage calls. Call handlers often supplement this by making free text notes covering key incident information. We investigate whether machine learning approaches using features from such free text notes can improve prediction of unconscious patients who require conveyance. Materials and methods: We analysed a subset of all London Ambulance Service calls that were triaged through the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) as involving an unconscious or fainting patient in 2018. We use and compare two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). For each incident, we predict whether the patient will be conveyed to a hospital emergency department or equivalent using as features 1) the MPDS code, 2) the free text notes and 3) the two together. We evaluate model performance using the area under the curve (AUC) metric. Given the imbalance of outcomes (patient conveyed 71 %, not conveyed 29 %), we also consider sensitivity and specificity. Results: Using only the MPDS code resulted in an AUC of 0.57. Using the text notes gave an improved AUC score of 0.63 and combining the two gave an AUC score of 0.64 (scores were similar for RF and GBM). GBM models scored better on sensitivity (0.93 vs 0.62 for RF in the combined model), but specificity was lower (0.17 vs. 0.56 for RF in the combined model). Conclusions: Using information contained in the free text notes made by call handlers in combination with MPDS improves prediction of unconscious and fainting patients requiring conveyance to a hospital emergency department (or equivalent) when compared with machine learning models using MPDS codes only. This suggests there is some useful information in unstructured data captured by emergency call handlers that complements MPDS codes. Quantifying this gain can help inform emergency medical service policy when evaluating the decision to expand or augment existing CDSS.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT compared with first RT-PCR results in adult patients suspected of COVID-19 infection in an ED setting. We also constructed a predictive machine learning model based on chest CT and additional data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT. Methods: This study’s cohort consisted of 319 patients who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR testing at the ED. Patient characteristics, demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT results (CO-RADS) were collected. With first RT-PCR as reference standard, the diagnostic performance of chest CT using the CO-RADS score was assessed. Additionally, a predictive machine learning model was constructed using logistic regression. Results: Chest CT, with first RT-PCR as a reference, had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90.2%, 88.2%, 84.5%, and 92.7%, respectively. The prediction model with CO-RADS, ferritin, leucocyte count, CK, days of complaints, and diarrhea as predictors had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 89.3%, 93.4%, 90.8%, and 92.3%, respectively. Conclusion: Chest CT, using the CO-RADS scoring system, is a sensitive and specific method that can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially if RT-PCR tests are scarce during an outbreak. Combining a predictive machine learning model could further improve the accuracy of diagnostic chest CT for COVID-19. Further candidate predictors should be analyzed to improve our model. However, RT-PCR should remain the primary standard of testing as up to 9% of RT-PCR positive patients are not diagnosed by chest CT or our machine learning model.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to assess the performance improvement for machine learning-based hospital length of stay (LOS) predictions when clinical signs written in text are accounted for and compared to the traditional approach of solely considering structured information such as age, gender and major ICD diagnosis. Methods: This study was an observational retrospective cohort study and analyzed patient stays admitted between 1 January to 24 September 2019. For each stay, a patient was admitted through the Emergency Department (ED) and stayed for more than two days in the subsequent service. LOS was predicted using two random forest models. The first included unstructured text extracted from electronic health records (EHRs). A word-embedding algorithm based on UMLS terminology with exact matching restricted to patient-centric affirmation sentences was used to assess the EHR data. The second model was primarily based on structured data in the form of diagnoses coded from the International Classification of Disease 10th Edition (ICD-10) and triage codes (CCMU/GEMSA classifications). Variables common to both models were: age, gender, zip/postal code, LOS in the ED, recent visit flag, assigned patient ward after the ED stay and short-term ED activity. Models were trained on 80% of data and performance was evaluated by accuracy on the remaining 20% test data. Results: The model using unstructured data had a 75.0% accuracy compared to 74.1% for the model containing structured data. The two models produced a similar prediction in 86.6% of cases. In a secondary analysis restricted to intensive care patients, the accuracy of both models was also similar (76.3% vs 75.0%). Conclusions: LOS prediction using unstructured data had similar accuracy to using structured data and can be considered of use to accurately model LOS.

AB  - Background: Emergency departments (ED) are becoming increasingly overwhelmed, increasing poor outcomes. Triage scores aim to optimize the waiting time and prioritize the resource usage. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms offer advantages for creating predictive clinical applications. Objective: Evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning model for predicting mortality at the triage level and, by validating this automatic tool, improve the categorization of patients in the ED. Design: An institutional review board (IRB) approval was granted for this retrospective study. Information of consecutive adult patients (ages 18–100) admitted at the emergency department (ED) of one hospital were retrieved (January 1, 2012–December 31, 2018). Features included the following: demographics, admission date, arrival mode, referral code, chief complaint, previous ED visits, previous hospitalizations, comorbidities, home medications, vital signs, and Emergency Severity Index (ESI). The following outcomes were evaluated: early mortality (up to 2 days post ED registration) and short-term mortality (2–30 days post ED registration). A gradient boosting model was trained on data from years 2012–2017 and examined on data from the final year (2018). The area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was used as an outcome metric. Single-variable analysis was conducted to develop a nine-point triage score for early mortality. Key Results: Overall, 799,522 ED visits were available for analysis. The early and short-term mortality rates were 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Models trained on the full set of features yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality and 0.923 for short-term mortality. A model that utilized the nine features with the highest single-variable AUC scores (age, arrival mode, chief complaint, five primary vital signs, and ESI) yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality. Conclusion: The gradient boosting model shows high predictive ability for screening patients at risk of early mortality utilizing data available at the time of triage in the ED.

AB  - Background: In emergency medical services (EMSs), accurately predicting the severity of a patient's medical condition is important for the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk. In this study, we developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on deep learning to predict the need for critical care during EMS. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observation cohort study. The algorithm was established using development data from the Korean national emergency department information system, which were collected during visits in real time from 151 emergency departments (EDs). We validated the algorithm using EMS run sheets from two EDs. The study subjects comprised adult patients who visited EDs. The endpoint was critical care, and we used age, sex, chief complaint, symptom onset to arrival time, trauma, and initial vital signs as the predicted variables. Results: The number of patients in the development data was 8,981,181, and the validation data comprised 2604 EMS run sheets from two hospitals. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the algorithm to predict the critical care was 0.867 (95% confidence interval, [0.864-0.871]). This result outperformed the Emergency Severity Index (0.839 [0.831-0.846]), Korean Triage and Acuity System (0.824 [0.815-0.832]), National Early Warning Score (0.741 [0.734-0.748]), and Modified Early Warning Score (0.696 [0.691-0.699]). Conclusions: The AI algorithm accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients using information during EMS and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores.

AB  - Background: Development of emergency department (ED) triage systems that accurately differentiate and prioritize critically ill from stable patients remains challenging. We used machine learning models to predict clinical outcomes, and then compared their performance with that of a conventional approach - the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). Methods: Using National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) ED data, from 2007 through 2015, we identified all adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years). In the randomly sampled training set (70%), using routinely available triage data as predictors (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, chief complaints, comorbidities), we developed four machine learning models: Lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. As the reference model, we constructed a logistic regression model using the five-level ESI data. The clinical outcomes were critical care (admission to intensive care unit or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the test set (the remaining 30%), we measured the predictive performance, including area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and net benefit (decision curves) for each model. Results: Of 135,470 eligible ED visits, 2.1% had critical care outcome and 16.2% had hospitalization outcome. In the critical care outcome prediction, all four machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.86 [95%CI 0.85-0.87] in the deep neural network vs 0.74 [95%CI 0.72-0.75] in the reference model), with less under-triaged patients in ESI triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to non-urgent). Likewise, in the hospitalization outcome prediction, all machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.82 [95%CI 0.82-0.83] in the deep neural network vs 0.69 [95%CI 0.68-0.69] in the reference model) with less over-triages in ESI triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). In the decision curve analysis, all machine learning models consistently achieved a greater net benefit - a larger number of appropriate triages considering a trade-off with over-triages - across the range of clinical thresholds. Conclusions: Compared to the conventional approach, the machine learning models demonstrated a superior performance to predict critical care and hospitalization outcomes. The application of modern machine learning models may enhance clinicians' triage decision making, thereby achieving better clinical care and optimal resource utilization.

AB  - Background: The primary objective of this review is to assess the accuracy of machine learning methods in their application of triaging the acuity of patients presenting in the Emergency Care System (ECS). The population are patients that have contacted the ambulance service or turned up at the Emergency Department. The index test is a machine-learning algorithm that aims to stratify the acuity of incoming patients at initial triage. This is in comparison to either an existing decision support tool, clinical opinion or in the absence of these, no comparator. The outcome of this review is the calibration, discrimination and classification statistics. Methods: Only derivation studies (with or without internal validation) were included. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and the grey literature were searched on the 14th December 2019. Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool and data was extracted using the CHARMS checklist. Discrimination (C-statistic) was a commonly reported model performance measure and therefore these statistics were represented as a range within each machine learning method. The majority of studies had poorly reported outcomes and thus a narrative synthesis of results was performed.

AB  - Background: Demand for both the ambulance service and the emergency department (ED) is rising every year and when this demand is excessive in both systems, ambulance crews queue at the ED waiting to hand patients over. Some transported ambulance patients are 'low-acuity' and do not require the treatment of the ED. However, paramedics can find it challenging to identify these patients accurately. Decision support tools have been developed using expert opinion to help identify these low acuity patients but have failed to show a benefit beyond regular decision-making. Predictive algorithms may be able to build accurate models, which can be used in the field to support the decision not to take a low-acuity patient to an ED.

AB  - Background: Currently, the risk stratification of critically ill patient with chest pain is a challenge. We aimed to use machine learning approach to predict the critical care outcomes in patients with chest pain, and simultaneously compare its performance with HEART, GRACE, and TIMI scores. Methods: This was a retrospective, case-control study in patients with acute non-traumatic chest pain who presented to the emergency department (ED) between January 2017 and December 2019. The outcomes included cardiac arrest, transfer to ICU, and death during treatment in ED. In the randomly sampled training set (70%), a LASSO regression model was developed, and presented with nomogram. The performance was measured in both training set (70% participants) and testing set (30% participants), and findings were compared with the three widely used scores. Results: We proposed a LASSO regression model incorporating mode of arrival, reperfusion therapy, Killip class, systolic BP, serum creatinine, creatine kinase-MB, and brain natriuretic peptide as independent predictors of critical care outcomes in patients with chest pain. Our model significantly outperformed the HEART, GRACE, TIMI score with AUC of 0.953 (95%CI: 0.922–0.984), 0.754 (95%CI: 0.675–0.832), 0.747 (95%CI: 0.664–0.829), 0.735 (95%CI: 0.655–0.815), respectively. Consistently, our model demonstrated better outcomes regarding the metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score. Similarly, the decision curve analysis elucidated a greater net benefit of our model over the full ranges of clinical thresholds. Conclusion: We present an accurate model for predicting the critical care outcomes in patients with chest pain, and provide substantial support to its application as a decision-making tool in ED.

AB  - Background: There is an urgent need to develop biomarkers that stratify risk of bacterial infection in order to support antimicrobial stewardship in emergency hospital admissions. Methods: We used computational machine learning to derive a rule-out blood transcriptomic signature of bacterial infection (SeptiCyte™ TRIAGE) from eight published case-control studies. We then validated this signature by itself in independent case-control data from more than 1500 samples in total, and in combination with our previously published signature for viral infections (SeptiCyte™ VIRUS) using pooled data from a further 1088 samples. Finally, we tested the performance of these signatures in a prospective observational cohort of emergency department (ED) patients with fever, and we used the combined SeptiCyte™ signature in a mixture modelling approach to estimate the prevalence of bacterial and viral infections in febrile ED patients without microbiological diagnoses. Results: The combination of SeptiCyte™ TRIAGE with our published signature for viral infections (SeptiCyte™ VIRUS) discriminated bacterial and viral infections in febrile ED patients, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.90-1), compared to 0.79 (0.68-0.91) for WCC and 0.73 (0.61-0.86) for CRP. At pre-test probabilities 0.35 and 0.72, the combined SeptiCyte™ score achieved a negative predictive value for bacterial infection of 0.97 (0.90-0.99) and 0.86 (0.64-0.96), compared to 0.90 (0.80-0.94) and 0.66 (0.48-0.79) for WCC and 0.88 (0.69-0.95) and 0.60 (0.31-0.72) for CRP. In a mixture modelling approach, the combined SeptiCyte™ score estimated that 24% of febrile ED cases receiving antibacterials without a microbiological diagnosis were due to viral infections. Our analysis also suggested that a proportion of patients with bacterial infection recovered without antibacterials. Conclusions: Blood transcriptional biomarkers offer exciting opportunities to support precision antibacterial prescribing in ED and improve diagnostic classification of patients without microbiologically confirmed infections.

AB  - Short-term reattendances to emergency departments are a key quality of care indicator. Identifying patients at increased risk of early reattendance could help reduce the number of missed critical illnesses and could reduce avoidable utilization of emergency departments by enabling targeted post-discharge intervention. In this manuscript, we present a retrospective, single-centre study where we created and evaluated an extreme gradient boosting decision tree model trained to identify patients at risk of reattendance within 72 h of discharge from an emergency department (University Hospitals Southampton Foundation Trust, UK). Our model was trained using 35,447 attendances by 28,945 patients and evaluated on a hold-out test set featuring 8847 attendances by 7237 patients. The set of attendances from a given patient appeared exclusively in either the training or the test set. Our model was trained using both visit level variables (e.g., vital signs, arrival mode, and chief complaint) and a set of variables available in a patients electronic patient record, such as age and any recorded medical conditions. On the hold-out test set, our highest performing model obtained an AUROC of 0.747 (95% CI 0.722–0.773) and an average precision of 0.233 (95% CI 0.194–0.277). These results demonstrate that machine-learning models can be used to classify patients, with moderate performance, into low and high-risk groups for reattendance. We explained our models predictions using SHAP values, a concept developed from coalitional game theory, capable of explaining predictions at an attendance level. We demonstrated how clustering techniques (the UMAP algorithm) can be used to investigate the different sub-groups of explanations present in our patient cohort.

AB  - Timely assessment to accurately prioritize patients is crucial for emergency department (ED) management. Urgent (i.e., level-3, on a 5-level emergency severity index system) patients have become a challenge since under-triage and over-triage often occur. This study was aimed to develop a computational model by artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies to accurately predict urgent patient outcomes using data that are readily available in most ED triage systems. We retrospectively collected data from the ED of a tertiary teaching hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. Eleven variables were used for data analysis and prediction model building, including 1 response, 2 demographic, and 8 clinical variables. A model to predict hospital admission was developed using neural networks and machine learning methodologies. A total of 282,971 samples of urgent (level-3) visits were included in the analysis. Our model achieved a validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8004 (95% CI 0.7963–0.8045). The optimal cutoff value identified by Youden's index for determining hospital admission was 0.5517. Using this cutoff value, the sensitivity was 0.6721 (95% CI 0.6624–0.6818), and the specificity was 0.7814 (95% CI 0.7777–0.7851), with a positive predictive value of 0.3660 (95% CI 0.3586–0.3733) and a negative predictive value of 0.9270 (95% CI 0.9244–0.9295). Subgroup analysis revealed that this model performed better in the nontraumatic adult subgroup and achieved a validation AUC of 0.8166 (95% CI 0.8199–0.8212). Our AI model accurately assessed the need for hospitalization for urgent patients, which constituted nearly 70% of ED visits. This model demonstrates the potential for streamlining ED operations using a very limited number of variables that are readily available in most ED triage systems. Subgroup analysis is an important topic for future investigation.

AB  - Early admission to the neurosciences intensive care unit (NSICU) is associated with improved patient outcomes. Natural language processing offers new possibilities for mining free text in electronic health record data. We sought to develop a machine learning model using both tabular and free text data to identify patients requiring NSICU admission shortly after arrival to the emergency department (ED). We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients at the Mount Sinai Hospital, an academic medical center in New York City. All patients presenting to our institutional ED between January 2014 and December 2018 were included. Structured (tabular) demographic, clinical, bed movement record data, and free text data from triage notes were extracted from our institutional data warehouse. A machine learning model was trained to predict likelihood of NSICU admission at 30 min from arrival to the ED. We identified 412,858 patients presenting to the ED over the study period, of whom 1900 (0.5%) were admitted to the NSICU. The daily median number of ED presentations was 231 (IQR 200–256) and the median time from ED presentation to the decision for NSICU admission was 169 min (IQR 80–324). A model trained only with text data had an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87–0.91). A structured data-only model had an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.91–0.94). A combined model trained on structured and text data had an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.92–0.95). At a false positive rate of 1:100 (99% specificity), the combined model was 58% sensitive for identifying NSICU admission. A machine learning model using structured and free text data can predict NSICU admission soon after ED arrival. This may potentially improve ED and NSICU resource allocation. Further studies should validate our findings.

AB  - Pediatric sepsis imposes a significant burden of morbidity and mortality among children. While the speedy application of existing supportive care measures can substantially improve outcomes, further improvements in delivering that care require tools that go beyond recognizing sepsis and towards predicting its development. Machine learning techniques have great potential as predictive tools, but their application to pediatric sepsis has been stymied by several factors, particularly the relative rarity of its occurrence. We propose an alternate approach which focuses on predicting the provision of resuscitative care, rather than sepsis diagnoses or criteria themselves. Using three years of Emergency Department data from a large academic medical center, we developed a boosted tree model that predicts resuscitation within 6 hours of triage, and significantly outperforms existing rule-based sepsis alerts.

AB  - Triage is crucial for patient’s management and estimation of the required intensive care unit (ICU) beds is fundamental for health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed whether chest computed tomography (CT) of COVID-19 pneumonia has an incremental role in predicting patient’s admission to ICU. We performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of 115 outpatients with COVID-19 infection presenting to the emergency room with dyspnea and unresponsive hypoxyemia. Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-reactive protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected. By calculating the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC), we compared the performance of blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models (Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomics)for predicting ICU admission. Following a machine learning approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set. Twenty-nine (25%) of patients were admitted to ICU. The Hybrid radiological model comprising the lung %consolidation performed significantly (p = 0.04) better in predicting ICU admission in the validation (AUC = 0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.73–0.97) set than the blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone (AUC = 0.71; 95% confidence interval 0.56–0.86). A risk calculator for ICU admission was derived and is available at: https://github.com/cgplab/covidapp. The volume of the consolidated lung in CT of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia has a mild but significant incremental value in predicting ICU admission.

AB  - Objectives: Pediatric asthma is a leading cause of emergency department (ED) utilization and hospitalization. Earlier identification of need for hospital-level care could triage patients more efficiently to high- or low-resource ED tracks. Existing tools to predict disposition for pediatric asthma use only clinical data, perform best several hours into the ED stay, and are static or score-based. Machine learning offers a population-specific, dynamic option that allows real-time integration of available nonclinical data at triage. Our objective was to compare the performance of four common machine learning approaches, incorporating clinical data available at the time of triage with information about weather, neighborhood characteristics, and community viral load for early prediction of the need for hospital-level care in pediatric asthma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients ages 2 to 18 years seen at two urban pediatric EDs with asthma exacerbation over 4 years. Asthma exacerbation was defined as receiving both albuterol and systemic corticosteroids. We included patient features, measures of illness severity available in triage, weather features, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza patterns. We tested four models: decision trees, LASSO logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. For each model, 80% of the data set was used for training and 20% was used to validate the models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve was calculated for each model. Results: There were 29,392 patients included in the analyses: mean (±SD) age of 7.0 (±4.2) years, 42% female, 77% non-Hispanic black, and 76% public insurance. The AUCs for each model were: decision tree 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66–0.77), logistic regression 0.83 (95% CI = 0.82–0.83), random forests 0.82 (95% CI = 0.81–0.83), and gradient boosting machines 0.84 (95% CI = 0.83–0.85). In the lowest decile of risk, only 3% of patients required hospitalization; in the highest decile this rate was 100%. After patient vital signs and acuity, age and weight, followed by socioeconomic status (SES) and weather-related features, were the most important for predicting hospitalization. Conclusions: Three of the four machine learning models performed well with decision trees preforming the worst. The gradient boosting machines model demonstrated a slight advantage over other approaches at predicting need for hospital-level care at the time of triage in pediatric patients presenting with asthma exacerbation. The addition of weight, SES, and weather data improved the performance of this model.

AB  - Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems which are capable of doing human intelligence tasks such as decision making and problem solving. AI-based tools have been used for predicting various factors in medicine including risk stratification, diagnosis and choice of treatment. AI can also be of considerable help in emergency departments, especially patients' triage. Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the application of AI in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain to estimate emergency severity index version 4 (ESI-4) score without the estimate of the required resources. Methods A mixed-model approach was used for predicting the ESI-4 score. Seventy percent of the patient cases were used for training the models and the remaining 30% for testing the accuracy of the models. During the training phase, patients were randomly selected and were given to systems for analysis. The output, which was the level of triage, was compared with the gold standard (emergency medicine physician). During the test phase of the study, another group of randomly selected patients were evaluated by the systems and the results were then compared with the gold standard. Results Totally, 215 patients who were triaged by the emergency medicine specialist were enrolled in the study. Triage Levels 1 and 5 were omitted due to low number of cases. In triage Level 2, all systems showed fair level of prediction with Neural Network being the highest. In Level 3, all systems again showed fair level of prediction. However, in triage Level 4, decision tree was the only system with fair prediction. Conclusion The application of AI in triage of patients with acute abdominal pain resulted in a model with acceptable level of accuracy. The model works with optimized number of input variables for quick assessment.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to develop a clinical tool capable of identifying discriminatory characteristics that can predict patients who will return within 72 hours to the Pediatric emergency department (PED). We studied 66,861 patients who were discharged from the EDs during the period from May 1 2009 to December 31 2009. We used a classification model to predict return visits based on factors extracted from patient demographic information, chief complaint, diagnosis, treatment, and hospital real-time ED statistics census. We began with a large pool of potentially important factors, and used particle swarm optimization techniques for feature selection coupled with an optimization-based discriminant analysis model (DAMIP) to identify a classification rule with relatively small subsets of discriminatory factors that can be used to predict-with 80% accuracy or greater-return within 72 hours. The analysis involves using a subset of the patient cohort for training and establishment of the predictive rule, and blind predicting the return of the remaining patients. Good candidate factors for revisit prediction are obtained where the accuracy of cross validation and blind prediction are over 80%. Among the predictive rules, the most frequent discriminatory factors identified include diagnosis (> 97%), patient complaint (>97%), and provider type (> 57%). There are significant differences in the readmission characteristics among different acuity levels. For Level 1 patients, critical readmission factors include patient complaint (>57%), time when the patient arrived until he/she got an ED bed (> 64%), and type/number of providers (>50%). For Level 4/5 patients, physician diagnosis (100%), patient complaint (99%), disposition type when patient arrives and leaves the ED (>30%), and if patient has lab test (>33%) appear to be significant. The model was demonstrated to be consistent and predictive across multiple PED sites. The resulting tool could enable ED staff and administrators to use patient specific values for each of a small number of discriminatory factors, and in return receive a prediction as to whether the patient will return to the ED within 72 hours. Our prediction accuracy can be as high as over 85%. This provides an opportunity for improving care and offering additional care or guidance to reduce ED readmission.

AB  - The triage note field of the Emergency Department (ED) patient record describes the reason for the patient's visit, including specific symptoms and incidents. Here we present the Triage Note Temporal Information Extraction System (TN-TIES), which systematically processes triage note text and outputs a human and machine readable interpretation of the timing of the events leading up to the ED visit. TN-TIES consists of chunking, classification, and interpretation processing stages. The results at each stage are promising. This system is a first step towards a complete interpretation and timeline presentation of all events that occurred before a patient's visit to the ED, which could help clinicians, public health officials, and others understand and visualize the data.

AB  - Objectives Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with nonspecific complaints are difficult to accurately triage, risk stratify, and diagnose. This can delay appropriate treatment. The extent to which key medical outcomes are at all predictable in these patients, and which (if any) predictors are useful, has previously been unclear. To investigate these questions, we tested an array of statistical and machine learning models in a large group of patients and estimated the predictability of mortality (which occurred in 6.6% of our sample of patients), acute morbidity (58%), and presence of acute infectious disease (28.2%). Methods To investigate whether the best available tools can predict the three key outcomes, we fed data from a sample of 1,278 ED patients with nonspecific complaints into 17 state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models. The patient sample stems from a diagnostic multicenter study with prospective 30-day follow-up conducted in Switzerland. Predictability of the three key medical outcomes was quantified by computing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each model. Results The models performed at different levels but, on average, the predictability of the target outcomes ranged between 0.71 and 0.82. The better models clearly outperformed physicians' intuitive judgments of how ill patients looked (AUC = 0.67 for mortality, 0.65 for morbidity, and 0.60 for infectious disease). Conclusions Modeling techniques can be used to derive formalized models that, on average, predict the outcomes of mortality, acute morbidity, and acute infectious disease in patients with nonspecific complaints with a level of accuracy far beyond chance. The models also predicted these outcomes more accurately than did physicians' intuitive judgments of how ill the patients look; however, the latter was among the small set of best predictors for mortality and acute morbidity. These results lay the groundwork for further refining triage and risk stratification tools for patients with nonspecific complaints. More research, informed by whether the goal of a model is high sensitivity or high specificity, is needed to develop readily applicable clinical decision support tools (e.g., decision trees) that could be supported by electronic health records.

Methods: In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and CINAHL from inception to October 17, 2019. We included studies comparing diagnostic and prognostic prediction of ED patients by ML models to usual care methods (triage-based scores, clinical prediction tools, clinician judgment) using predictor variables readily available to ED clinicians. We extracted commonly reported performance metrics of model discrimination and classification. We used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020158129). Results: The search yielded 1,656 unique records, of which 23 studies involving 16,274,647 patients were included. In all seven diagnostic studies, ML models outperformed usual care in all performance metrics. In six studies assessing in-hospital mortality, the best-performing ML models had better discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] =0.74–0.94) than any clinical decision tool (AUROC =0.68–0.81). In four studies assessing hospitalization, ML models had better discrimination (AUROC =0.80–0.83) than triage-based scores (AUROC =0.68–0.82). Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Most studies had high risk of bias due to lack of external validation, low event rates, and insufficient reporting of calibration. Conclusions: Our review suggests that ML may have better prediction performance than usual care for ED patients with a variety of clinical presentations and outcomes. However, prediction model reporting guidelines should be followed to provide clinically applicable data. Interventional trials are needed to assess the impact of ML models on patient-centered outcomes.

AB  - AIM: The emergence and evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has generated  increasing interest in machine learning applications for health care. Specifically, researchers are grasping the potential of machine learning solutions to enhance the quality of care in emergency medicine. METHODS: We undertook a narrative review of published works on machine learning applications in emergency medicine and provide a synopsis of recent developments. RESULTS: This review describes fundamental concepts of machine learning and presents clinical applications for triage, risk stratification specific to disease, medical imaging, and emergency department operations. Additionally, we consider how machine learning models could contribute to the improvement of causal inference in medicine, and to conclude, we discuss barriers to safe implementation of AI. CONCLUSION: We intend that this review serves as an introduction to AI and machine learning in emergency medicine.

AB  - Introduction: A key aim of triage is to identify those with high risk of cardiac arrest, as they require intensive monitoring, resuscitation facilities, and early intervention. We aim to validate a novel machine learning (ML) score incorporating heart rate variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS).Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients (Patient Acuity Category Scale 1 and 2) in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5-minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death.Results: From June 2006 to June 2008 we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781, compared with 0.680 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.101, 95% confidence interval: 0.006 to 0.197). As for in-hospital death, the area under the curve for ML score is 0.741, compared with 0.693 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.048, 95% confidence interval: -0.023 to 0.119). A cutoff ML score ≥ 60 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 84.1%, specificity of 72.3% and negative predictive value of 98.8%. A cutoff MEWS ≥ 3 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 74.4%, specificity of 54.2% and negative predictive value of 97.8%.Conclusion: We found ML scores to be more accurate than the MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours. There is potential to develop bedside devices for risk stratification based on cardiac arrest prediction. © 2012 Ong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Computed tomography (CT)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) enables the noninvasive functional assessment of coronary artery stenosis. We evaluated the feasibility and potential clinical role of FFRCT in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain who underwent chest-pain CT (CPCT). Methods: For this retrospective IRB-approved study, we included 56 patients (median age: 62 years, 14 females) with acute chest pain who underwent CPCT and who had at least a mild (≥25% diameter) coronary artery stenosis. CPCT was evaluated for the presence of acute plaque rupture and vulnerable plaque features. FFRCT measurements were performed using a machine learning-based software. We assessed the agreement between the results from FFRCT and patient outcome (including results from invasive catheter angiography and from any non-invasive cardiac imaging test, final clinical diagnosis and revascularization) for a follow-up of 3 months. Results: FFRCT was technically feasible in 38/56 patients (68%). Eleven of the 38 patients (29%) showed acute plaque rupture in CPCT; all of them underwent immediate coronary revascularization. Of the remaining 27 patients (71%), 16 patients showed vulnerable plaque features (59%), of whom 11 (69%) were diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 10 (63%) underwent coronary revascularization. In patients with vulnerable plaque features in CPCT, FFRCT had an agreement with outcome in 12/16 patients (75%). In patients without vulnerable plaque features (n=11), one patient showed myocardial ischemia (9%). In these patients, FFRCT and patient outcome showed an agreement in 10/11 patients (91%). Conclusions: Our preliminary data show that FFRCT is feasible in patients with acute chest pain who undergo CPCT provided that image quality is sufficient. FFRCT has the potential to improve patient triage by reducing further downstream testing but appears of limited value in patients with CT signs of acute plaque rupture.

AB  - Syndromic surveillance systems that incorporate electronic free-text data have primarily focused on extracting concepts of interest from chief complaint text, emergency department visit notes, and nurse triage notes. Due to availability and access, there has been limited work in the area of surveilling the full text of all electronic note documents compared with more specific document sources. This study provides an evaluation of the performance of a text classifier for detection of influenza-like illness (ILI) by document sources that are commonly used for biosurveillance by comparing them to routine visit notes, and a full electronic note corpus approach. Evaluating the performance of an automated text classifier for syndromic surveillance by source document will inform decisions regarding electronic textual data sources for potential use by automated biosurveillance systems. Even when a full electronic medical record is available, commonly available surveillance source documents provide acceptable statistical performance for automated ILI surveillance.

AB  - This study was aimed at exploring the new management mode of medical information processing and emergency first aid nursing management under the new artificial intelligence technology. This study will use the artificial intelligence algorithm to optimize medical information processing and emergency first aid nursing management process, in order to improve the efficiency of emergency department and first aid efficiency. The successful rescue rates of hemorrhagic shock, coma, dyspnea, and more than three organs injury were 96.7%, 92.5%, 93.7%, and 87.2%, respectively, after the emergency first aid nursing mode was used in the hospital emergency center. The success rates of first aid within three years were compared, which were 91.8%, 93.4%, and 94.2%, respectively, showing an increasing trend year by year. 255 emergency patients in five batches in June and five batches in July were selected as the research objects by convenience sampling method. Among them, 116 cases in June were taken as the experimental group, and 139 cases in July were taken as the control group, which was used to verify the efficiency of the design model in this study. The results showed that the triage time of the two groups was 8.16±2.07 min and 19.21±6.36 min, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). The triage coincidence rates were 96.35% and 90.04%, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The research proved that the design of intelligent medical information processing and emergency first aid nursing management research model can effectively improve the triage efficiency of the wounded, assist the efficiency of emergency nursing of medical staff, and improve the survival rate of emergency patients, which is worthy of clinical promotion.

AB  - An early-warning model to predict in-hospital mortality on admission of COVID-19 patients at an emergency department (ED) was developed and validated using a machine-learning model. In total, 2782 patients were enrolled between March 2020 and December 2020, including 2106 patients (first wave) and 676 patients (second wave) in the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The first-wave patients were divided into two groups with 1474 patients used to train the model, and 632 to validate it. The 676 patients in the second wave were used to test the model. Age, 17 blood analytes, and Brescia chest X-ray score were the variables processed using a random forests classi¬fication algorithm to build and validate the model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the model performances. A web-based death-risk calculator was implemented and integrated within the Laboratory Information System of the hospital. The final score was constructed by age (the most powerful predictor), blood analytes (the strongest predictors were lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte %, ferritin std, and monocyte %), and Brescia chest X-ray score (https://bdbiomed.shinyapps.io/covid- 19score/). The areas under the ROC curve obtained for the three groups (training, validating, and testing) were 0.98, 0.83, and 0.78, respectively. The model predicts in-hospital mortality on the basis of data that can be obtained in a short time, directly at the ED on admission. It functions as a web- based calculator, providing a risk score which is easy to interpret. It can be used in the triage process to support the decision on patient allocation.

AB  - In-hospital cardiac arrest remains a leading cause of death: roughly 300,000  in-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States, ≈10% of which occur in the emergency department. ED-based cardiac arrest may represent a subset of in-hospital cardiac arrest with a higher proportion of reversible etiologies and a higher potential for neurologically intact survival. Patients presenting to the ED have become increasingly complex, have a high burden of critical illness, and face crowded departments with thinly stretched resources. As a result, patients in the ED are vulnerable to unrecognized clinical deterioration that may lead to ED-based cardiac arrest. Efforts to identify patients who may progress to ED-based cardiac arrest have traditionally been approached through identification of critically ill patients at triage and the identification of patients who unexpectedly deteriorate during their stay in the ED. Interventions to facilitate appropriate triage and resource allocation, as well as earlier identification of patients at risk of deterioration in the ED, could potentially allow for both prevention of cardiac arrest and optimization of outcomes from ED-based cardiac arrest. This review will discuss the epidemiology of ED-based cardiac arrest, as well as commonly used approaches to predict ED-based cardiac arrest and highlight areas that require further research to improve outcomes for this population.

AB  - Introduction: Patients boarding in the Emergency Department can contribute to overcrowding, leading to longer waiting times and patients leaving without being seen or completing their treatment. The early identification of potential admissions could act as an additional decision support tool to alert clinicians that a patient needs to be reviewed for admission and would also be of benefit to bed managers in advance bed planning for the patient. We aim to create a low-dimensional model predicting admissions early from the paediatric Emergency Department. Methods and Analysis: The methodology Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) will be followed. The dataset will comprise of 2 years of data, ~76,000 records. Potential predictors were identified from previous research, comprising of demographics, registration details, triage assessment, hospital usage and past medical history. Fifteen models will be developed comprised of 3 machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, naïve Bayes and gradient boosting machine) and 5 sampling methods, 4 of which are aimed at addressing class imbalance (undersampling, oversampling, and synthetic oversampling techniques). The variables of importance will then be identified from the optimal model (selected based on the highest Area under the curve) and used to develop an additional low-dimensional model for deployment. Discussion: A low-dimensional model comprised of routinely collected data, captured up to post triage assessment would benefit many hospitals without data rich platforms for the development of models with a high number of predictors. Novel to the planned study is the use of data from the Republic of Ireland and the application of sampling techniques aimed at improving model performance impacted by an imbalance between admissions and discharges in the outcome variable.

AB  - Background: Establishing rapport and empathy between patients and their health care provider is important but challenging in the context of a busy and crowded emergency department (ED). Objective: We explore the hypotheses that rapport building, documentation, and time efficiency might be improved in the ED by providing patients a digital tool that uses Bayesian reasoning–based techniques to gather relevant symptoms and history for handover to clinicians. Methods: A 2-phase pilot evaluation was carried out in the ED of a German tertiary referral and major trauma hospital that treats an average of 120 patients daily. Phase 1 observations guided iterative improvement of the digital tool, which was then further evaluated in phase 2. All patients who were willing and able to provide consent were invited to participate, excluding those with severe injury or illness requiring immediate treatment, with traumatic injury, incapable of completing a health assessment, and aged <18 years. Over an 18-day period with 1699 patients presenting to the ED, 815 (47.96%) were eligible based on triage level. With available recruitment staff, 135 were approached, of whom 81 (60%) were included in the study. In a mixed methods evaluation, patients entered information into the tool, accessed by clinicians through a dashboard. All users completed evaluation Likert-scale questionnaires rating the tool’s performance. The feasibility of a larger trial was evaluated through rates of recruitment and questionnaire completion. Results: Respondents strongly endorsed the tool for facilitating conversation (61/81, 75% of patients, 57/78, 73% of physician ratings, and 10/10, 100% of nurse ratings). Most nurses judged the tool as potentially time saving, whereas most physicians only agreed for a subset of medical specialties (eg, surgery). Patients reported high usability and understood the tool’s questions. The tool was recommended by most patients (63/81, 78%), in 53% (41/77) of physician ratings, and in 76% (61/80) of nurse ratings. Questionnaire completion rates were 100% (81/81) by patients and 96% (78/81 enrolled patients) by physicians. Conclusions: This pilot confirmed that a larger study in the setting would be feasible. The tool has clear potential to improve patient–health care provider interaction and could also contribute to ED efficiency savings. Future research and development will extend the range of patients for whom the history-taking tool has clinical utility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate triage in the emergency department (ED) is critical for medical  safety and operational efficiency. We aimed to predict the number of future required ED resources, as defined by the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage protocol, using natural language processing of nursing triage notes. METHODS: We constructed a retrospective cohort of all 265,572 consecutive ED encounters from 2015 to 2016 from 3 separate clinically heterogeneous academically affiliated EDs. We excluded encounters missing relevant information, leaving 226,317 encounters. We calculated the number of resources used by patients in the ED retrospectively and based outcome categories on criteria defined in the ESI algorithm: 0 (30,604 encounters), 1 (49,315 encounters), and 2 or more (146,398 encounters). A neural network model was trained on a training subset to predict the number of resources using triage notes and clinical variables at triage. Model performance was evaluated using the test subset and was compared with human ratings. RESULTS: Overall model accuracy and macro F1 score for number of resources were 66.5% and 0.601, respectively. The model had similar macro F1 (0.589 vs 0.592) and overall accuracy (65.9% vs 69.0%) compared to human raters. Model predictions had slightly higher F1 scores and accuracy for 0 resources and were less accurate for 2 or more resources. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning of nursing triage notes, combined with clinical data available at ED presentation, can be used to predict the number of required future ED resources. These findings suggest that machine learning may be a valuable adjunct tool in the initial triage of ED patients.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) forced rapid adaptations in the way healthcare is delivered and coordinated by health systems. Brazil has a universal public health system (Sistema Unico de Saúde—SUS), being the main source of care for 75% of the population. Therefore, a saturation of the system was foreseen with the continuous increase of cases. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to empower telehealth could help to tackle this by increasing a coordinated patient access to the health system. In the present study we describe a descriptive case report analyzing the use of Laura Digital Emergency Room—an AI-powered telehealth platform—in three different cities. It was computed around 130,000 interactions made by the chatbot and 24,162 patients completed the digital triage. Almost half (44.8%) of the patients were classified as having mild symptoms, 33.6% were classified as moderate and only 14.2% were classified as severe. The implementation of an AI-powered telehealth to increase accessibility while maintaining safety and leveraging value amid the unprecedent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was feasible in Brazil and may reduce healthcare overload. New efforts to yield sustainability of affordable and scalable solutions are needed to truly leverage value in health care systems, particularly in the context of middle-low-income countries.

AB  - Importance: While machine learning approaches may enhance prediction ability, little is known about their utility in emergency department (ED) triage. Objectives: To examine the performance of machine learning approaches to predict clinical outcomes and disposition in children in the ED and to compare their performance with conventional triage approaches. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prognostic study of ED data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2015. A nationally representative sample of 52037 children aged 18 years or younger who presented to the ED were included. Data analysis was performed in August 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes were critical care (admission to an intensive care unit and/or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the training set (70% random sample), using routinely available triage data as predictors (eg, demographic characteristics and vital signs), we derived 4 machine learning-based models: lasso regression, random forest, gradient-boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. In the test set (the remaining 30% of the sample), we measured the models' prediction performance by computing C statistics, prospective prediction results, and decision curves. These machine learning models were built for each outcome and compared with the reference model using the conventional triage classification information. Results: Of 52037 eligible ED visits by children (median [interquartile range] age, 6 [2-14] years; 24929 [48.0%] female), 163 (0.3%) had the critical care outcome and 2352 (4.5%) had the hospitalization outcome. For the critical care prediction, all machine learning approaches had higher discriminative ability compared with the reference model, although the difference was not statistically significant (eg, C statistics of 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.92] for the deep neural network vs 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71-0.85] for the reference; P =.16), and lower number of undertriaged critically ill children in the conventional triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to nonurgent). For the hospitalization prediction, all machine learning approaches had significantly higher discrimination ability (eg, C statistic, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.78-0.81] for the deep neural network vs 0.73 [95% CI, 0.71-0.75] for the reference; P <.001) and fewer overtriaged children who did not require inpatient management in the conventional triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). The decision curve analysis demonstrated a greater net benefit of machine learning models over ranges of clinical thresholds. Conclusions and Relevance: Machine learning-based triage had better discrimination ability to predict clinical outcomes and disposition, with reduction in undertriaging critically ill children and overtriaging children who are less ill..

AB  - Objectives: Triage is a process to accurately assess and classify symptoms to identify and provide rapid treatment to patients. The Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) is used as a triage instrument in all emergency centers. The aim of this study was to train and compare machine learning models to predict KTAS levels. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using data from a single emergency department of a tertiary university hospital. Information collected during triage was used in the analysis. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost were used to predict the KTAS level. Results: The models with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were the random forest and XGBoost models trained on the entire dataset (AUROC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval 0.917–0.925 and AUROC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval 0.918–0.925, respectively). The AUROC of the models trained on the clinical data was higher than that of models trained on text data only, but the models trained on all variables had the highest AUROC among similar machine learning models. Conclusions: Machine learning can robustly predict the KTAS level at triage, which may have many possibilities for use, and the addition of text data improves the predictive performance compared to that achieved by using structured data alone.

AB  - Importance: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the standard for the rapid diagnosis of intracranial injury, but it is costly and exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules for identifying children with minor head trauma who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) are widely used to triage CT imaging. Objective: To examine whether optimal classification trees (OCTs), which are novel machine-learning classifiers, improve on PECARN rules' predictive accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of prospective, publicly available data on emergency department visits for head trauma used by the PECARN group to develop their tool was conducted to derive OCT-based prediction rules for ciTBI in a development cohort and compare their predictive performance vs the PECARN rules in a validation cohort among children who were younger than 2 years and 2 years or older. Data on 42412 children with head trauma and without severely altered mental status who were examined between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, were gathered from 25 emergency departments in North America participating in PECARN. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2016, to December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was ciTBI, with predictive performance measured by estimating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the OCT and the PECARN rules. The OCT and PECARN rules' performance was compared by estimating ratios for each measure. Results: Of the 42412 children (15 996 [37.7%] girls) included in the analysis, 10718 were younger than 2 years (25.3%; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [0.6] months) and 31694 were 2 years or older (74.7%; age, 9.1 [4.9] years). Compared with PECARN rules, OCTs misclassified 0 vs 1 child with ciTBI in the younger and 10 vs 9 children with ciTBI in the older cohort, and correctly identified more children with very low risk of ciTBI in the younger (7605 vs 5701) and older (20 594 vs 18 134) cohorts. In the validation cohorts, compared with the PECARN rules, the OCTs had statistically significantly better specificity (in the younger cohort: 69.3%; 95% CI, 67.4%-71.2% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 50.8%-54.9%; in the older cohort: 65.6%; 95% CI, 64.5%-66.8% vs 57.6%; 95% CI, 56.4%-58.8%), positive predictive value (odds ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively), and positive likelihood ratio (risk ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio between the 2 sets of rules. Conclusions and Relevance: If implemented, OCTs may help reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans, without missing more patients with ciTBI than the PECARN rules..

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop machine learning (ML) and initial nursing assessment (INA)-based emergency department (ED) triage to predict adverse clinical outcome. Methods: The retrospective study included ED visits between January 2016 and December 2017 that resulted in either intensive care unit admission or emergency room death. We trained four classifiers using logistic regression and a deep learning model on INA and low dimensional (LD) INA, logistic regression on the Korea Triage and acuity scale (KTAS) and Sequential Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). We varied the outcome ratio for external validation. Finally, variables of importance were identified using the random forest model’s information gain. The four most influential variables were used for LD modeling for efficiency. Results: A total of 86,304 patient visits were included, with an overall outcome rate of 3.5%. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the KTAS model were 76.8 (74.9–78.6) with logistic regression and 74.0 (72.1–75.9) for the SOFA model, while the AUC values of the INA model were 87.2 (85.9–88.6) and 87.6 (86.3–88.9) with logistic regression and deep learning, suggesting that the ML and INA-based triage system result more accurately predicted the outcomes. The AUC values for the LD model were 81.2 (79.4–82.9) and 80.7 (78.9–82.5) for logistic regression and deep learning, respectively. Conclusions: We developed an ML and INA-based triage system for EDs. The novel system was able to predict clinical outcomes more accurately than existing triage systems, KTAS and SOFA.

AB  - Background: Rapid triage reduces the patients’ stay time at an emergency department (ED). The Korean Triage Acuity Scale (KTAS) is mandatorily applied at EDs in South Korea. For rapid triage, we studied machine learning-based triage systems composed of a speech recognition model and natural language processing-based classification. Methods: We simulated 762 triage cases that consisted of 18 classes with six types of the main symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, fever, stroke, abdominal pain, and headache) and three levels of KTAS. In addition, we recorded conversations between emergency patients and clinicians during the simulation. We used speech recognition models to transcribe the conversation. Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used for KTAS and symptom classification. Additionally, we evaluated the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values of features to interpret the classifiers. Results: The character error rate of the speech recognition model was reduced to 25.21% through transfer learning. With auto-transcribed scripts, support vector machine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.9), KNN (AUROC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.93), RF (AUROC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.9) and BERT (AUROC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.87) achieved excellent classification performance. Based on SHAP, we found “stress”, “pain score point”, “fever”, “breath”, “head” and “chest” were the important vocabularies for determining KTAS and symptoms. Conclusion: We demonstrated the potential of an automatic KTAS classification system using speech recognition models, machine learning and BERT-based classifiers.

AB  - Accurate stratification of sepsis can effectively guide the triage of patient care and shared decision making in the emergency department (ED). However, previous research on sepsis identification models focused mainly on ICU patients, and discrepancies in model performance between the development and external validation datasets are rarely evaluated. The aim of our study was to develop and externally validate a machine learning model to stratify sepsis patients in the ED. We retrospectively collected clinical data from two geographically separate institutes that provided a different level of care at different time periods. The Sepsis-3 criteria were used as the reference standard in both datasets for identifying true sepsis cases. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was developed to stratify sepsis patients and the performance of the model was compared with traditional clinical sepsis tools; quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). There were 8296 patients (1752 (21%) being septic) in the development and 1744 patients (506 (29%) being septic) in the external validation datasets. The mortality of septic patients in the development and validation datasets was 13.5% and 17%, respectively. In the internal validation, XGBoost achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86, exceeding SIRS (0.68) and qSOFA (0.56). The performance of XGBoost deteriorated in the external validation (the AUROC of XGBoost, SIRS and qSOFA was 0.75, 0.57 and 0.66, respectively). Heterogeneity in patient characteristics, such as sepsis prevalence, severity, age, comorbidity and infection focus, could reduce model performance. Our model showed good discriminative capabilities for the identification of sepsis patients and outperformed the existing sepsis identification tools. Implementation of the ML model in the ED can facilitate timely sepsis identification and treatment. However, dataset discrepancies should be carefully evaluated before implementing the ML approach in clinical practice. This finding reinforces the necessity for future studies to perform external validation to ensure the generalisability of any developed ML approaches.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to severe adverse clinical outcomes, including death and disability. Early detection of in-hospital mortality in high-risk populations may enable early treatment and potentially reduce mortality using machine learning. However, there is limited information on in-hospital mortality prediction models for TBI patients admitted to emergency departments. The aim of this study was to create a model that successfully predicts, from clinical measures and demographics, in-hospital mortality in a sample of TBI patients admitted to the emergency department. Of the 4881 TBI patients who were screened at the emergency department at a high-level first aid duty hospital in northern Taiwan, 3331 were assigned in triage to Level I or Level II using the Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale from January 2008 to June 2018. The most significant predictors of in-hospital mortality in TBI patients were the scores on the Glasgow coma scale, the injury severity scale, and systolic blood pressure in the emergency department admission. This study demonstrated the effective cutoff values for clinical measures when using machine learning to predict in-hospital mortality of patients with TBI. The prediction model has the potential to further accelerate the development of innovative care-delivery protocols for high-risk patients.

AB  - Background: The early clinical course of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses driving presentation to hospital. However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. Methods: We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. Findings: We assessed 155 689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114 957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115 394 patients, with 72 310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 95·7% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0·939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 94·8% specificity (AUROC 0·940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >98·5%) across a range of prevalences (≤5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 92·3% accuracy (NPV 97·6%, AUROC 0·881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 92·5% accuracy (97·7%, 0·871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 95·1%, admissions model 94·1%) and NPV (ED model 99·0%, admissions model 98·5%). Interpretation: Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

AB  - Early identification of high-risk septic patients in the emergency department (ED) may guide appropriate management and disposition, thereby improving outcomes. We compared the performance of machine learning models against conventional risk stratification tools, namely the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and our previously described Singapore ED Sepsis (SEDS) model, in the prediction of 30-day in-hospital mortality (IHM) among suspected sepsis patients in the ED.Adult patients who presented to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) ED between September 2014 and April 2016, and who met ≥2 of the 4 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria were included. Patient demographics, vital signs and heart rate variability (HRV) measures obtained at triage were used as predictors. Baseline models were created using qSOFA, NEWS, MEWS, and SEDS scores. Candidate models were trained using k-nearest neighbors, random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting and support vector machine. Models were evaluated on F1 score and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).A total of 214 patients were included, of whom 40 (18.7%) met the outcome. Gradient boosting was the best model with a F1 score of 0.50 and AUPRC of 0.35, and performed better than all the baseline comparators (SEDS, F1 0.40, AUPRC 0.22; qSOFA, F1 0.32, AUPRC 0.21; NEWS, F1 0.38, AUPRC 0.28; MEWS, F1 0.30, AUPRC 0.25).A machine learning model can be used to improve prediction of 30-day IHM among suspected sepsis patients in the ED compared to traditional risk stratification tools.

AB  - In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been promisingly applied in many fields of clinical medicine, both for diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Aims of this narrative review were to summarize the basic concepts of ML applied to clinical medicine and explore its main applications in the emergency department (ED) setting, with a particular focus on syncope management. Through an extensive literature search in PubMed and Embase, we found increasing evidence suggesting that the use of ML algorithms can improve ED triage, diagnosis, and risk stratification of many diseases. However, the lacks of external validation and reliable diagnostic standards currently limit their implementation in clinical practice. Syncope represents a challenging problem for the emergency physician both because its diagnosis is not supported by specific tests and the available prognostic tools proved to be inefficient. ML algorithms have the potential to overcome these limitations and, in the future, they could support the clinician in managing syncope patients more efficiently. However, at present only few studies have addressed this issue, albeit with encouraging results.

AB  - Background: Electronic medical records (EMRs) hold a tremendous amount of information about patients that is relevant to determining the optimal approach to patient care. As medicine becomes increasingly precise, a patient's electronic medical record phenotype will play an important role in triggering clinical decision support systems that can deliver personalized recommendations in real time. Learning with anchors presents a method of efficiently learning statistically driven phenotypes with minimal manual intervention. Materials and Methods: We developed a phenotype library that uses both structured and unstructured data from the EMR to represent patients for real-time clinical decision support. Eight of the phenotypes were evaluated using retrospective EMR data on emergency department patients using a set of prospectively gathered gold standard labels. Results: We built a phenotype library with 42 publicly available phenotype definitions. Using information from triage time, the phenotype classifiers have an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of infection 0.89, cancer 0.88, immuno-suppressed 0.85, septic shock 0.93, nursing home 0.87, anticoagulated 0.83, cardiac etiology 0.89, and pneumonia 0.90. Using information available at the time of disposition from the emergency department, the AUC values are infection 0.91, cancer 0.95, immunosuppressed 0.90, septic shock 0.97, nursing home 0.91, anticoagulated 0.94, cardiac etiology 0.92, and pneumonia 0.97. Discussion: The resulting phenotypes are interpretable and fast to build, and perform comparably to statistically learned phenotypes developed with 5000 manually labeled patients. Conclusion: Learning with anchors is an attractive option for building a large public repository of phenotype definitions that can be used for a range of health IT applications, including real-time decision support.

AB  - The testing of informatics tools designed for use during mass casualty incidents presents a unique problem as there is no readily available population of victims or identical exposure setting. The purpose of this article is to describe the process of designing, planning, and executing a functional exercise to accomplish the research objective of validating an informatics tool specifically designed to identify and triage victims of irritant gas syndrome agents. Materials and Methods: During a 3-year time frame, the research team and partners developed the Emergency Department Informatics Computational Tool and planned a functional exercise to test it using medical records data from 298 patients seen in 1 emergency department following a chlorine gas exposure in 2005. Results: The research team learned valuable lessons throughout the planning process that will assist future researchers with developing a functional exercise to test informatics tools. Key considerations for a functional exercise include contributors, venue, and information technology needs (ie, hardware, software, and data collection methods). Discussion: Due to the nature of mass casualty incidents, testing informatics tools and technology for these incidents is challenging. Previous studies have shown a functional exercise as a viable option to test informatics tools developed for use during mass casualty incidents. Conclusion: Utilizing a functional exercise to test new mass casualty management technology and informatics tools involves a painstaking and complex planning process; however, it does allow researchers to address issues inherent in studying informatics tools for mas casualty incidents.

AB  - Objective: To develop prediction models for intensive care unit (ICU) vs non-ICU level-of-care need within 24 hours of inpatient admission for emergency department (ED) patients using electronic health record data. Materials and Methods: Using records of 41 654 ED visits to a tertiary academic center from 2015 to 2019, we tested 4 algorithms - feed-forward neural networks, regularized regression, random forests, and gradient-boosted trees - to predict ICU vs non-ICU level-of-care within 24 hours and at the 24th hour following admission. Simple-feature models included patient demographics, Emergency Severity Index (ESI), and vital sign summary. Complex-feature models added all vital signs, lab results, and counts of diagnosis, imaging, procedures, medications, and lab orders. Results: The best-performing model, a gradient-boosted tree using a full feature set, achieved an AUROC of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.87-0.89) and AUPRC of 0.65 (95%CI: 0.63-0.68) for predicting ICU care need within 24 hours of admission. The logistic regression model using ESI achieved an AUROC of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.65-0.70) and AUPRC of 0.37 (95%CI: 0.35-0.40). Using a discrimination threshold, such as 0.6, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity were 85%, 89%, 30%, and 99%, respectively. Vital signs were the most important predictors. Discussion and Conclusions: Undertriaging admitted ED patients who subsequently require ICU care is common and associated with poorer outcomes. Machine learning models using readily available electronic health record data predict subsequent need for ICU admission with good discrimination, substantially better than the benchmarking ESI system. The results could be used in a multitiered clinical decision-support system to improve ED triage.

AB  - Objective: Automated syndrome classification aims to aid near real-time syndromic surveillance to serve as an early warning system for disease outbreaks, using Emergency Department (ED) data. We present a system that improves the automatic classification of an ED record with triage note into one or more syndrome categories using the vector space model coupled with a ‘learning’ module that employs a pseudo-relevance feedback mechanism.Materials and Methods: Terms from standard syndrome definitions are used to construct an initial reference dictionary for generating the syndrome and triage note vectors. Based on cosine similarity between the vectors, each record is classified into a syndrome category. We then take terms from the top-ranked records that belong to the syndrome of interest as feedback. These terms are added to the reference dictionary and the process is repeated to determine the final classification. The system was tested on two different datasets for each of three syndromes: Gastro-Intestinal (GI), Respiratory (Resp) and Fever-Rash (FR). Performance was measured in terms of sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp).Results: The use of relevance feedback produced high values of sensitivity and specificity for all three syndromes in both test sets:  GI: 90% and 71%, Resp: 97% and 73%, FR: 100% and 87%, respectively, in test set 1, and GI: 88% and 69%, Resp: 87% and 61%, FR: 97% and 71%, respectively, in test set 2.Conclusions: The new system for pre-processing and syndromic classification of ED records with triage notes achieved improvements in Se and Sp. Our results also demonstrate that the system can be tuned to achieve different levels of performance based on user requirements.

AB  - Background: The emergency department (ED) triage system to classify and prioritize patients from high risk to less urgent continues to be a challenge. Objective: This study, comprising 80,433 patients, aims to develop a machine learning algorithm prediction model of critical care outcomes for adult patients using information collected during ED triage and compare the performance with that of the baseline model using the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS). Methods: To predict the need for critical care, we used 13 predictors from triage information: age, gender, mode of ED arrival, the time interval between onset and ED arrival, reason of ED visit, chief complaints, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness. The baseline model with KTAS was developed using logistic regression, and the machine learning model with 13 variables was generated using extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. The discrimination was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. The ability of calibration with Hosmer-Lemeshow test and reclassification with net reclassification index were evaluated. The calibration plot and partial dependence plot were used in the analysis. Results: The AUROC of the model with the full set of variables (0.833-0.861) was better than that of the baseline model (0.796). The XGB model of AUROC 0.861 (95% CI 0.848-0.874) showed a higher discriminative performance than the DNN model of 0.833 (95% CI 0.819-0.848). The XGB and DNN models proved better reclassification than the baseline model with a positive net reclassification index. The XGB models were well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow test; P>.05); however, the DNN showed poor calibration power (Hosmer-Lemeshow test; P<.001). We further interpreted the nonlinear association between variables and critical care prediction. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the performance of the XGB model using initial information at ED triage for predicting patients in need of critical care outperformed the conventional model with KTAS.

AB  - Background: Predicting early respiratory failure due to COVID-19 can help triage patients to higher levels of care, allocate scarce resources, and reduce morbidity and mortality by appropriately monitoring and treating the patients at greatest risk for deterioration. Given the complexity of COVID-19, machine learning approaches may support clinical decision making for patients with this disease. Objective: Our objective is to derive a machine learning model that predicts respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission based on data from the emergency department. Methods: Data were collected from patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Northwell Health acute care hospitals and were discharged, died, or spent a minimum of 48 hours in the hospital between March 1 and May 11, 2020. Of 11,525 patients, 933 (8.1%) were placed on invasive mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of admission. Variables used by the models included clinical and laboratory data commonly collected in the emergency department. We trained and validated three predictive models (two based on XGBoost and one that used logistic regression) using cross-hospital validation. We compared model performance among all three models as well as an established early warning score (Modified Early Warning Score) using receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves, and other metrics. Results: The XGBoost model had the highest mean accuracy (0.919; area under the curve=0.77), outperforming the other two models as well as the Modified Early Warning Score. Important predictor variables included the type of oxygen delivery used in the emergency department, patient age, Emergency Severity Index level, respiratory rate, serum lactate, and demographic characteristics. Conclusions: The XGBoost model had high predictive accuracy, outperforming other early warning scores. The clinical plausibility and predictive ability of XGBoost suggest that the model could be used to predict 48-hour respiratory failure in admitted patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Early detection and intervention are the key factors for improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this observational longitudinal study was to identify nonoverlapping severity subgroups (ie, clusters) among patients with COVID-19, based exclusively on clinical data and standard laboratory tests obtained during patient assessment in the emergency department. Methods: We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols. Results: From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests - the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils - were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3. Conclusions: A few standard laboratory tests, deemed available in all emergency departments, have shown good discriminative power for the characterization of severity subgroups among patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Uncertainty in patients' COVID-19 status contributes to treatment delays, nosocomial transmission, and operational pressures in hospitals. However, the typical turnaround time for laboratory PCR remains 12–24 h and lateral flow devices (LFDs) have limited sensitivity. Previously, we have shown that artificial intelligence-driven triage (CURIAL-1.0) can provide rapid COVID-19 screening using clinical data routinely available within 1 h of arrival to hospital. Here, we aimed to improve the time from arrival to the emergency department to the availability of a result, do external and prospective validation, and deploy a novel laboratory-free screening tool in a UK emergency department. Methods: We optimised our previous model, removing less informative predictors to improve generalisability and speed, developing the CURIAL-Lab model with vital signs and readily available blood tests (full blood count [FBC]; urea, creatinine, and electrolytes; liver function tests; and C-reactive protein) and the CURIAL-Rapide model with vital signs and FBC alone. Models were validated externally for emergency admissions to University Hospitals Birmingham, Bedfordshire Hospitals, and Portsmouth Hospitals University National Health Service (NHS) trusts, and prospectively at Oxford University Hospitals, by comparison with PCR testing. Next, we compared model performance directly against LFDs and evaluated a combined pathway that triaged patients who had either a positive CURIAL model result or a positive LFD to a COVID-19-suspected clinical area. Lastly, we deployed CURIAL-Rapide alongside an approved point-of-care FBC analyser to provide laboratory-free COVID-19 screening at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK). Our primary improvement outcome was time-to-result, and our performance measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Findings: 72 223 patients met eligibility criteria across the four validating hospital groups, in a total validation period spanning Dec 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. CURIAL-Lab and CURIAL-Rapide performed consistently across trusts (AUROC range 0·858–0·881, 95% CI 0·838–0·912, for CURIAL-Lab and 0·836–0·854, 0·814–0·889, for CURIAL-Rapide), achieving highest sensitivity at Portsmouth Hospitals (84·1%, Wilson's 95% CI 82·5–85·7, for CURIAL-Lab and 83·5%, 81·8–85·1, for CURIAL-Rapide) at specificities of 71·3% (70·9–71·8) for CURIAL-Lab and 63·6% (63·1–64·1) for CURIAL-Rapide. When combined with LFDs, model predictions improved triage sensitivity from 56·9% (51·7–62·0) for LFDs alone to 85·6% with CURIAL-Lab (81·6–88·9; AUROC 0·925) and 88·2% with CURIAL-Rapide (84·4–91·1; AUROC 0·919), thereby reducing missed COVID-19 cases by 65% with CURIAL-Lab and 72% with CURIAL-Rapide. For the prospective deployment of CURIAL-Rapide, 520 patients were enrolled for point-of-care FBC analysis between Feb 18 and May 10, 2021, of whom 436 received confirmatory PCR testing and ten (2·3%) tested positive. Median time from arrival to a CURIAL-Rapide result was 45 min (IQR 32–64), 16 min (26·3%) sooner than with LFDs (61 min, 37–99; log-rank p<0·0001), and 6 h 52 min (90·2%) sooner than with PCR (7 h 37 min, 6 h 5 min to 15 h 39 min; p<0·0001). Classification performance was high, with sensitivity of 87·5% (95% CI 52·9–97·8), specificity of 85·4% (81·3–88·7), and negative predictive value of 99·7% (98·2–99·9). CURIAL-Rapide correctly excluded infection for 31 (58·5%) of 53 patients who were triaged by a physician to a COVID-19-suspected area but went on to test negative by PCR. Interpretation: Our findings show the generalisability, performance, and real-world operational benefits of artificial intelligence-driven screening for COVID-19 over standard-of-care in emergency departments. CURIAL-Rapide provided rapid, laboratory-free screening when used with near-patient FBC analysis, and was able to reduce the number of patients who tested negative for COVID-19 but were triaged to COVID-19-suspected areas.

AB  - Background: Development of emergency department (ED) triage systems that accurately differentiate and prioritize critically ill from stable patients remains challenging. We used machine learning models to predict clinical outcomes, and then compared their performance with that of a conventional approach - the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). Methods: Using National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) ED data, from 2007 through 2015, we identified all adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years). In the randomly sampled training set (70%), using routinely available triage data as predictors (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, chief complaints, comorbidities), we developed four machine learning models: Lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. As the reference model, we constructed a logistic regression model using the five-level ESI data. The clinical outcomes were critical care (admission to intensive care unit or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the test set (the remaining 30%), we measured the predictive performance, including area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and net benefit (decision curves) for each model. Results: Of 135,470 eligible ED visits, 2.1% had critical care outcome and 16.2% had hospitalization outcome. In the critical care outcome prediction, all four machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.86 [95%CI 0.85-0.87] in the deep neural network vs 0.74 [95%CI 0.72-0.75] in the reference model), with less under-triaged patients in ESI triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to non-urgent). Likewise, in the hospitalization outcome prediction, all machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.82 [95%CI 0.82-0.83] in the deep neural network vs 0.69 [95%CI 0.68-0.69] in the reference model) with less over-triages in ESI triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). In the decision curve analysis, all machine learning models consistently achieved a greater net benefit - a larger number of appropriate triages considering a trade-off with over-triages - across the range of clinical thresholds. Conclusions: Compared to the conventional approach, the machine learning models demonstrated a superior performance to predict critical care and hospitalization outcomes. The application of modern machine learning models may enhance clinicians' triage decision making, thereby achieving better clinical care and optimal resource utilization.

AB  - Objective To predict hospital admission at the time of ED triage using patient history in addition to information collected at triage. Methods This retrospective study included all adult ED visits between March 2014 and July 2017 from one academic and two community emergency rooms that resulted in either admission or discharge. A total of 972 variables were extracted per patient visit. Samples were randomly partitioned into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. We trained a series of nine binary classifiers using logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural networks (DNN) on three dataset types: one using only triage information, one using only patient history, and one using the full set of variables. Next, we tested the potential benefit of additional training samples by training models on increasing fractions of our data. Lastly, variables of importance were identified using information gain as a metric to create a low-dimensional model. Results A total of 560,486 patient visits were included in the study, with an overall admission risk of 29.7%. Models trained on triage information yielded a test AUC of 0.87 for LR (95% CI 0.86–0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.87–0.88) and 0.87 for DNN (95% CI 0.87–0.88). Models trained on patient history yielded an AUC of 0.86 for LR (95% CI 0.86–0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.87–0.87) and 0.87 for DNN (95% CI 0.87–0.88). Models trained on the full set of variables yielded an AUC of 0.91 for LR (95% CI 0.91–0.91), 0.92 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.92–0.93) and 0.92 for DNN (95% CI 0.92–0.92). All algorithms reached maximum performance at 50% of the training set or less. A low-dimensional XGBoost model built on ESI level, outpatient medication counts, demographics, and hospital usage statistics yielded an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.91–0.91). Conclusion Machine learning can robustly predict hospital admission using triage information and patient history. The addition of historical information improves predictive performance significantly compared to using triage information alone, highlighting the need to incorporate these variables into prediction models.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate the incremental benefit of using free text data in addition to vital sign and demographic data to identify patients with suspected infection in the emergency department. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study performed at a tertiary academic teaching hospital. All consecutive ED patient visits between 12/17/08 and 2/17/13 were included. No patients were excluded. The primary outcome measure was infection diagnosed in the emergency department defined as a patient having an infection related ED ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis. Patients were randomly allocated to train (64%), validate (20%), and test (16%) data sets. After preprocessing the free text using bigram and negation detection, we built four models to predict infection, incrementally adding vital signs, chief complaint, and free text nursing assessment. We used two different methods to represent free text: a bag of words model and a topic model. We then used a support vector machine to build the prediction model. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the discriminatory power of each model. Results: A total of 230,936 patient visits were included in the study. Approximately 14% of patients had the primary outcome of diagnosed infection. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the vitals model, which used only vital signs and demographic data, was 0.67 for the training data set, 0.67 for the validation data set, and 0.67 (95% CI 0.65-0.69) for the test data set. The AUC for the chief complaint model which also included demographic and vital sign data was 0.84 for the training data set, 0.83 for the validation data set, and 0.83 (95% CI 0.81-0.84) for the test data set. The best performing methods made use of all of the free text. In particular, the AUC for the bag-of-words model was 0.89 for training data set, 0.86 for the validation data set, and 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87) for the test data set. The AUC for the topic model was 0.86 for the training data set, 0.86 for the validation data set, and 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.86) for the test data set. Conclusion: Compared to previous work that only used structured data such as vital signs and demographic information, utilizing free text drastically improves the discriminatory ability (increase in AUC from 0.67 to 0.86) of identifying infection.

AB  - Background: Emergency departments (ED) are becoming increasingly overwhelmed, increasing poor outcomes. Triage scores aim to optimize the waiting time and prioritize the resource usage. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms offer advantages for creating predictive clinical applications. Objective: Evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning model for predicting mortality at the triage level and, by validating this automatic tool, improve the categorization of patients in the ED. Design: An institutional review board (IRB) approval was granted for this retrospective study. Information of consecutive adult patients (ages 18–100) admitted at the emergency department (ED) of one hospital were retrieved (January 1, 2012–December 31, 2018). Features included the following: demographics, admission date, arrival mode, referral code, chief complaint, previous ED visits, previous hospitalizations, comorbidities, home medications, vital signs, and Emergency Severity Index (ESI). The following outcomes were evaluated: early mortality (up to 2 days post ED registration) and short-term mortality (2–30 days post ED registration). A gradient boosting model was trained on data from years 2012–2017 and examined on data from the final year (2018). The area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was used as an outcome metric. Single-variable analysis was conducted to develop a nine-point triage score for early mortality. Key Results: Overall, 799,522 ED visits were available for analysis. The early and short-term mortality rates were 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Models trained on the full set of features yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality and 0.923 for short-term mortality. A model that utilized the nine features with the highest single-variable AUC scores (age, arrival mode, chief complaint, five primary vital signs, and ESI) yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality. Conclusion: The gradient boosting model shows high predictive ability for screening patients at risk of early mortality utilizing data available at the time of triage in the ED.

AB  - Objectives: Pediatric asthma is a leading cause of emergency department (ED) utilization and hospitalization. Earlier identification of need for hospital-level care could triage patients more efficiently to high- or low-resource ED tracks. Existing tools to predict disposition for pediatric asthma use only clinical data, perform best several hours into the ED stay, and are static or score-based. Machine learning offers a population-specific, dynamic option that allows real-time integration of available nonclinical data at triage. Our objective was to compare the performance of four common machine learning approaches, incorporating clinical data available at the time of triage with information about weather, neighborhood characteristics, and community viral load for early prediction of the need for hospital-level care in pediatric asthma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients ages 2 to 18 years seen at two urban pediatric EDs with asthma exacerbation over 4 years. Asthma exacerbation was defined as receiving both albuterol and systemic corticosteroids. We included patient features, measures of illness severity available in triage, weather features, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza patterns. We tested four models: decision trees, LASSO logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. For each model, 80% of the data set was used for training and 20% was used to validate the models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve was calculated for each model. Results: There were 29,392 patients included in the analyses: mean (±SD) age of 7.0 (±4.2) years, 42% female, 77% non-Hispanic black, and 76% public insurance. The AUCs for each model were: decision tree 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66–0.77), logistic regression 0.83 (95% CI = 0.82–0.83), random forests 0.82 (95% CI = 0.81–0.83), and gradient boosting machines 0.84 (95% CI = 0.83–0.85). In the lowest decile of risk, only 3% of patients required hospitalization; in the highest decile this rate was 100%. After patient vital signs and acuity, age and weight, followed by socioeconomic status (SES) and weather-related features, were the most important for predicting hospitalization. Conclusions: Three of the four machine learning models performed well with decision trees preforming the worst. The gradient boosting machines model demonstrated a slight advantage over other approaches at predicting need for hospital-level care at the time of triage in pediatric patients presenting with asthma exacerbation. The addition of weight, SES, and weather data improved the performance of this model.

AB  - Increase in the number of casualties visit to Emergency Department (ED) have lead to over crowd and delay in medical care. Hence, electronic triaging has been deployed to alleviate these problems and improve managing the patient. In this paper research methodology framework based on diagnostic and cross-sectional study is used for patient triage. The empirical approach is used to build models for patient triage to correctly predict the patient’s medical condition, given their signs and symptoms. Models are built with supervised learning algorithms. The “Naive Bayes”, “Support Vector Machine”, “Decision Tree” and, “Neural Network” classification models are implemented and evaluated using chi-square statistical test. This study infers the significance of using machine learning algorithms to predict patient’s medical condition. Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree have shown better performance for the considered dataset.

AB  - Purpose: In this study, we aimed to develop a novel prediction model to identify patients in need of a non-contrast head CT exam during emergency department (ED) triage. Methods: We collected data of all adult ED visits in our institution for five consecutive years (1/2013–12/2017). Retrieved variables included the following: demographics, mode of arrival to the ED, comorbidities, home medications, structured and unstructured chief complaints, vital signs, pain scale score, emergency severity index, ED wing assignment, documentation of previous ED visits, hospitalizations and CTs, and current visit non-contrast head CT usage. A machine learning gradient boosting model was trained on data from the years 2013–2016 and tested on data from 2017. Area under the curve (AUC) was used as metrics. Single-variable AUCs were also determined. Youden’s index evaluated optimal sensitivity and specificity of the models. Results: The final cohort included 595,561 ED visits. Non-contrast head CT usage rate was 11.8%. Each visit was coded into an input vector of 171 variables. Single-variable analysis showed that chief complaint had the best single predictive analysis (AUC = 0.87). The best model showed an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.931–0.936) for predicting non-contrast head CT usage at triage level. The model had a sensitivity of 88.1% and specificity of 85.7% for non-contrast head CT utilization. Conclusion: The developed model can identify patients that need to undergo head CT exam already in the ED triage level and by that allow faster diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT compared with first RT-PCR results in adult patients suspected of COVID-19 infection in an ED setting. We also constructed a predictive machine learning model based on chest CT and additional data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT. Methods: This study’s cohort consisted of 319 patients who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR testing at the ED. Patient characteristics, demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT results (CO-RADS) were collected. With first RT-PCR as reference standard, the diagnostic performance of chest CT using the CO-RADS score was assessed. Additionally, a predictive machine learning model was constructed using logistic regression. Results: Chest CT, with first RT-PCR as a reference, had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90.2%, 88.2%, 84.5%, and 92.7%, respectively. The prediction model with CO-RADS, ferritin, leucocyte count, CK, days of complaints, and diarrhea as predictors had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 89.3%, 93.4%, 90.8%, and 92.3%, respectively. Conclusion: Chest CT, using the CO-RADS scoring system, is a sensitive and specific method that can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially if RT-PCR tests are scarce during an outbreak. Combining a predictive machine learning model could further improve the accuracy of diagnostic chest CT for COVID-19. Further candidate predictors should be analyzed to improve our model. However, RT-PCR should remain the primary standard of testing as up to 9% of RT-PCR positive patients are not diagnosed by chest CT or our machine learning model.

AB  - Background: The primary objective of this review is to assess the accuracy of machine learning methods in their application of triaging the acuity of patients presenting in the Emergency Care System (ECS). The population are patients that have contacted the ambulance service or turned up at the Emergency Department. The index test is a machine-learning algorithm that aims to stratify the acuity of incoming patients at initial triage. This is in comparison to either an existing decision support tool, clinical opinion or in the absence of these, no comparator. The outcome of this review is the calibration, discrimination and classification statistics. Methods: Only derivation studies (with or without internal validation) were included. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and the grey literature were searched on the 14th December 2019. Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool and data was extracted using the CHARMS checklist. Discrimination (C-statistic) was a commonly reported model performance measure and therefore these statistics were represented as a range within each machine learning method. The majority of studies had poorly reported outcomes and thus a narrative synthesis of results was performed.

AB  - Aim Triage is important in identifying high-risk patients amongst many less urgent patients as emergency department (ED) overcrowding has become a national crisis recently. This study aims to validate that a Deep-learning-based Triage and Acuity Score (DTAS) identifies high-risk patients more accurately than existing triage and acuity scores using a large national dataset. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using data from the Korean National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS), which collected data on visits in real time from 151 EDs. The NEDIS data was split into derivation data (January 2014-June 2016) and validation data (July-December 2016). We also used data from the Sejong General Hospital (SGH) for external validation (January-December 2017). We predicted inhospital mortality, critical care, and hospitalization using initial information of ED patients (age, sex, chief complaint, time from symptom onset to ED visit, arrival mode, trauma, initial vital signs and mental status as predictor variables). Results A total of 11,656,559 patients were included in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision and Recall Curve (AUPRC) of DTAS were 0.935 and 0.264. It significantly outperformed Korean triage and acuity score (AUROC:0.785, AUPRC:0.192), modified early warning score (AUROC:0.810, AUPRC:0.116), logistic regression (AUROC:0.903, AUPRC:0.209), and random forest (AUROC:0.910, AUPRC:0.179). Conclusion Deep-learning-based Triage and Acuity Score predicted in-hospital mortality, critical care, and hospitalization more accurately than existing triages and acuity, and it was validated using a large, multicenter dataset.

AB  - Objective: Accurate triage in the emergency department (ED) is critical for medical safety and operational efficiency. We aimed to predict the number of future required ED resources, as defined by the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage protocol, using natural language processing of nursing triage notes. Methods: We constructed a retrospective cohort of all 265,572 consecutive ED encounters from 2015 to 2016 from 3 separate clinically heterogeneous academically affiliated EDs. We excluded encounters missing relevant information, leaving 226,317 encounters. We calculated the number of resources used by patients in the ED retrospectively and based outcome categories on criteria defined in the ESI algorithm: 0 (30,604 encounters), 1 (49,315 encounters), and 2 or more (146,398 encounters). A neural network model was trained on a training subset to predict the number of resources using triage notes and clinical variables at triage. Model performance was evaluated using the test subset and was compared with human ratings. Results: Overall model accuracy and macro F1 score for number of resources were 66.5% and 0.601, respectively. The model had similar macro F1 (0.589 vs 0.592) and overall accuracy (65.9% vs 69.0%) compared to human raters. Model predictions had slightly higher F1 scores and accuracy for 0 resources and were less accurate for 2 or more resources. Conclusions: Machine learning of nursing triage notes, combined with clinical data available at ED presentation, can be used to predict the number of required future ED Supervising Editor: Christian A.

Results: Overall model accuracy and macro F1 score for number of resources were 66.5% and 0.601, respectively. The model had similar macro F1 (0.589 vs 0.592) and overall accuracy (65.9% vs 69.0%) compared to human raters. Model predictions had slightly higher F1 scores and accuracy for 0 resources and were less accurate for 2 or more resources. Conclusions: Machine learning of nursing triage notes, combined with clinical data available at ED presentation, can be used to predict the number of required future ED Supervising Editor: Christian A.

AB  - Background Emergency department (ED) crowding is associated with negative health outcomes, patient dissatisfaction, and longer length of stay (LOS). The addition of advanced diagnostic imaging (ADI), namely CT, ultrasound (U/S), and MRI to ED encounter work up is a predictor of longer length of stay. Earlier and improved prediction of patients’ need for advanced imaging may improve overall ED efficiency. The aim of the study was to detect the association between ADI utilization and the structured and unstructured information immediately available during ED triage, and to develop and validate models to predict utilization of ADI during an ED encounter. Methods We used the United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data from 2009 to 2014 to examine which sociodemographic and clinical factors immediately available at ED triage were associated with the utilization of CT, U/S, MRI, and multiple ADI during a patient’s ED stay. We used natural language processing (NLP) topic modeling to incorporate free-text reason for visit data available at time of ED triage in addition to other structured patient data to predict the use of ADI using multivariable logistic regression models. Results Among the 139,150 adult ED visits from a national probability sample of hospitals across the U.S, 21.9% resulted in ADI use, including 16.8% who had a CT, 3.6% who had an ultrasound, 0.4% who had an MRI, and 1.2% of the population who had multiple types of ADI. The c-statistic of the predictive models was greater than or equal to 0.78 for all imaging outcomes, and the addition of text-based reason for visit information improved the accuracy of all predictive models. Conclusions Patient information immediately available during ED triage can accurately predict the eventual use of advanced diagnostic imaging during an ED visit. Such models have the potential to be incorporated into the ED triage workflow in order to more rapidly identify patients who may require advanced imaging during their ED stay and assist with medical decision-making.

AB  - Objective To test the feasibility of classifying emergency department patients into severity grades using data mining methods. Design Emergency department records of 402 patients were classified into five severity grades by two expert physicians. The Naïve Bayes and C4.5 algorithms were applied to produce classifiers from patient data into severity grades. The classifiers' results over several subsets of the data were compared with the physicians' assessments, with a random classifier, and with a classifier that selects the maximal-prevalence class. Measurements Positive predictive value, multiple-class extensions of sensitivity and specificity combinations, and entropy change. Results The mean accuracy of the data mining classifiers was 52.94 5.89%, significantly better (P < 0.05) than the mean accuracy of a random classifier (34.60 2.40%). The entropy of the input data sets was reduced through classification by a mean of 10.1%. Allowing for classification deviations of one severity grade led to mean accuracy of 85.42 1.42%. The classifiers' accuracy in that case was similar to the physicians' consensus rate. Learning from consensus records led to better performance. Reducing the number of severity grades improved results in certain cases. The performance of the Naïve Bayes and C4.5 algorithms was similar; in unbalanced data sets, Naïve Bayes performed better. Conclusions It is possible to produce a computerized classification model for the severity grade of triage patients, using data mining methods. Learning from patient records regarding which there is a consensus of several physicians is preferable to learning from each physician's patients. Either Naïve Bayes or C4.5 can be used; Naïve Bayes is preferable for unbalanced data sets. An ambiguity in the intermediate severity grades seems to hamper both the physicians' agreement and the classifiers' accuracy.

AB  - As hospitals increasingly use electronic medical records for research and quality improvement, it is important to provide ways to structure medical data without losing either expressiveness or time. We present a system that helps achieve this goal by building an extended ontology of chief complaints and automatically predicting a patient's chief complaint, based on their vitals and the nurses' description of their state at arrival.

AB  - High demand periods and under-staffing due to financial constraints cause Emergency Departments (EDs) to frequently exhibit over-crowding and slow response times to provide adequate patient care. In response, Lean Thinking has been applied to help alleviate some of these issues and improve patient handling, with success. Lean approaches in EDs include separate patient streams, with low-complexity patients treated in a so-called Fast Track, in order to reduce total waiting time and to free-up capacity to treat more complicated patients in a timely manner. In this work we propose the use of Machine Learning techniques in a Lean Pediatric ED to correctly predict which patients should be admitted to the Fast Track, given their signs and symptoms. Charts from 1205 patients of the emergency department of Hospital Napoleón Franco Pareja in Cartagena - Colombia, were used to construct a dataset and build several predictive models. Validation and test results are promising and support the validity of this approach and further research on the subject.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Triage quickly identifies critically ill patients, facilitating timely interventions. Many emergency departments (EDs) use emergency severity index (ESI) or abnormal vital sign triggers to guide triage. However, both use fixed thresholds, and false activations are costly. Prior approaches using machinelearning have relied on information that is often unavailable during the triage process. We examined whether deep-learning approaches could identify critically ill patients only using data immediately available at triage. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study at an urban tertiary care center, from January 1, 2012-January 1, 2020. De-identified triage information included structured (age, sex, initial vital signs) and textual (chief complaint) data, with critical illness (mortality or ICU admission within 24 hours) as the outcome. Four progressively complex deep-learning models were trained and applied to triage information from all patients. We compared the accuracy of the models against ESI as the standard diagnostic test, using area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 445,925 patients were included, with 60,901 (13.7%) critically ill. Vital sign thresholds identified critically ill patients with AUC 0.521 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.519-0.522), and ESI <3 demonstrated AUC 0.672 (95% CI = 0.671-0.674), logistic regression classified patients with AUC 0.803 (95% CI = 0.802-0.804), 2-layer neural network with structured data with AUC 0.811 (95% CI = 0.807-0.815), gradient tree boosting with AUC 0.820 (95% CI = 0.818-0.821), and the neural network model with textual data with AUC 0.851 (95% CI = 0.849-0.852). All successive increases in AUC were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Deep-learning techniques represent a promising method of augmenting triage, even with limited information. Further research is needed to determine if improved predictions yield clinical and operational benefits.

AB  - Objective: To further develop and refine an Emergency Department (ED) in-patient admission prediction model using machine learning techniques. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of statewide ED data from New South Wales, Australia. Six classification algorithms (Bayesian networks, decision trees, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, neural networks and nearest neighbour) and five feature selection techniques (none, manual, correlation-based, information gain and wrapper) were examined. Presenting problem was categorised using broad (n = 20) and specific (n = 100) representations. Models were evaluated based on Area Under the Curve (AUC) and accuracy. The results were compared with the Sydney Triage to Admission Risk Tool (START), which uses logistic regression and six manually selected features. Results: Sixty admission prediction models were trained and validated using data from 1 721 294 patients. Under the broad representation of presenting problem, the nearest neighbour algorithm with manual feature selection had the best AUC of 0.8206 (95% CI AE0.0006), while the decision tree with no feature selection had the best accuracy of 74.83% (95% CI AE0.065). Under the specific representation, almost all models improved; the nearest neighbour with information gain feature selection had the best AUC of 0.8267 (95% CI AE0.0006), while the decision tree with wrapper or no feature selection had the best accuracy of 75.24% (95% CI AE0.064). Eleven of the machine learning models had slightly better AUC than the START model. Conclusion: Machine learning methods demonstrate similar performance to logistic regression for ED disposition prediction models using basic triage information. This should be investigated further, especially for larger data sets with more complex clinical information.

AB  - The public specialty ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong, under the Hospital Authority, receive tens of thousands of referrals each year. Triaging these referrals incurs a significant workload for practitioners and the other clinical duties. It is well-established that Hong Kong is currently facing a shortage of healthcare workers. Thus a more efficient system in triaging will not only free up resources for better use but also improve the satisfaction of both practitioners and patients. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to improve the efficiency of various medical workflows, including triaging, by both reducing the workload and increasing accuracy in some cases. Despite a myriad of studies on medical artificial intelligence, there is no specific framework for a triaging algorithm in ophthalmology clinics. This study proposes a general framework for developing, deploying and evaluating an ML-based triaging algorithm in a clinical setting. Through literature review, this study identifies good practices in various facets of developing such a network and protocols for maintenance and evaluation of the impact concerning clinical utility and external validity out of the laboratory. We hope this framework, albeit not exhaustive, can act as a foundation to accelerate future pilot studies and deployments.

AB  - Key messages What is already known on this subject ► Multiple observational studies have been performed across different settings to determine the accuracy of triage nurse prediction of emergency patient disposition. ► Results have been variable across studies. What this study adds ► This paper reports a meta-analysis of observational studies which finds triage nurse prediction of disposition is not sufficiently accurate to aid admission planning on a one-to-one basis. AbSTrACT Introduction Exit block is the most significant cause of poor patient flow and crowding in the emergency department (ED). One proposed strategy to reduce exit block is early admission predictions by triage nurses to allow proactive bed management. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the accuracy of nurse prediction of admission at triage. Methodology We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL and grey literature, up to and including February 2019. Our criteria were as follows: prospective studies analysing the accuracy of triage nurse intuition-after gathering standard triage information-for predicting disposition for adult ED patients. We analysed the results of this test-nurse prediction of disposition-in a diagnostic test analysis review style, assessing methodology with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 checklist. We generated sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios (LRs). We used LRs and pretest probability of admission (baseline admission rate) to find positive and negative post-test probabilities. results We reviewed 10 articles. Of these, seven had meta-analysable data (12 282 participants). The studies varied in participant selection and admission rate, but the majority were of moderate quality and exclusion of each in sensitivity analyses made little difference. Sensitivity was 72% and specificity was 83%. Pretest probability of admission was 29%. Positive and negative post-test probabilities of admission were 63% and 12%, respectively. Conclusion Triage nurse prediction of disposition is not accurate enough to expedite admission for ED patients on a one-to-one basis. Future research should explore the benefit, and best method, of predicting total demand.

AB  - AI virtual assistants have significant potential to alleviate the pressure on overly burdened healthcare systems by enabling patients to self-assess their symptoms and to seek further care when appropriate. For these systems to make a meaningful contribution to healthcare globally, they must be trusted by patients and healthcare professionals alike, and service the needs of patients in diverse regions and segments of the population. We developed an AI virtual assistant which provides patients with triage and diagnostic information. Crucially, the system is based on a generative model, which allows for relatively straightforward re-parameterization to reflect local disease and risk factor burden in diverse regions and population segments. This is an appealing property, particularly when considering the potential of AI systems to improve the provision of healthcare on a global scale in many regions and for both developing and developed countries. We performed a prospective validation study of the accuracy and safety of the AI system and human doctors. Importantly, we assessed the accuracy and safety of both the AI and human doctors independently against identical clinical cases and, unlike previous studies, also accounted for the information gathering process of both agents. Overall, we found that the AI system is able to provide patients with triage and diagnostic information with a level of clinical accuracy and safety comparable to that of human doctors. Through this approach and study, we hope to start building trust in AI-powered systems by directly comparing their performance to human doctors, who do not always agree with each other on the cause of patients’ symptoms or the most appropriate triage recommendation.

AB  - In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) visiting the emergency department (ED), clinical decisions must be made based on their disease prognosis. This study aims to predict the disease outcome of patients visiting the ED for the first time after NSCLC diagnosis. This study included patients who visited the ED in 2016-2020 after being diagnosed with NSCLC in study site or within 30 days before the first outpatient clinic visit after diagnosis. Primary outcome of prediction model was 3-month mortality from the initial ED visit. We analyzed the association between outcome and each variable as a risk factor and built a prediction model using these variables. Both oncologic factors and ED-associated factors were associated with the 3-month mortality of NSCLC from the first ED visit. We also visualized the treatment trace as a sequence and utilized it in prediction model building. The areas under the receiver operating curve (AUROCs) of the prediction model of 3-month mortality from the first ED visit ranged from 0.677 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.640-0.708) to 0.729 (95% CI, 0.697-0.761). This study provides the prediction model about 3-month survival in first ED visit point and identified patient and disease-related factors to predict the prognosis of patients.

AB  - Hospital challenges and employing artificial intelligence to tackle those challenges has been the topic of copious research. A key issue in any hospital is the triage unit which is ever more significant in heart specialized hospitals. Employing artificial intelligence methods especially the fuzzy method is a great help to medical diagnosis and prioritizing the patients in the cardiac ward. In the present research, the Mamdani's fuzzy model was used to prioritize the triage rules in the hospital cardiac ward. As a developmental study, the present research aimed to propose and evaluate the patient prioritization system applied in the triage of a heart specialized hospital. The system evaluation results obtained from the data provided by 200 patient visitors of Rajaei Cardiovascular, Medical & Research Center revealed that the proposed system, which enjoyed a sensitivity of 93% , accuracy of 96% and specificity of 97%, managed to have a proper prediction of the level of triage in the heart emergency room. The system also has this privilege that it has observed almost all the key factors involved in predicting the level of triage. Fuzzy logic has come to the help of medical specialists. The present research used Mamdani fuzzy algorithm to classify patients in terms of their initial vital signs, nurses' and doctors' diagnosis. The proposed algorithm is capable of predicting of triage level in the heart emergency room with a sensitivity of 93%, accuracy of 96% and specificity of 97%.

AB  -  Introduction: Overcrowded emergency departments (ED) and undifferentiated patients make the provision of care and resources challenging. We examined whether machine learning algorithms could identify ED patients’ disposition (hospitalization and critical care admission) using readily available objective triage data among patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients who were triaged at the ED for a suspected coronary event. A total of 162 input variables (k) were extracted from the electronic health record: demographics (k=3), mode of transportation (k=1), past medical/surgical history (k=57), first ED vital signs (k=7), home medications (k=31), symptomology (k=40), and the computer generated automatic interpretation of 12-lead electrocardiogram (k=23). The primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical care admission (i.e., admission to intensive or step-down care unit). We used 10-fold stratified cross validation to evaluate the performance of five machine learning algorithms to predict the study outcomes: logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forest, gradient boosting and artificial neural network classifiers. We determined the best model by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of all models.  Results: Included were 1201 patients (age 64±14, 39% female; 10% Black) with a total of 956 hospitalizations, and 169 critical care admissions. The best performing machine learning classifier for the outcome of hospitalization was gradient boosting machine with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.82–0.89), 89% sensitivity, and F-score of 0.83; random forest classifier performed the best for the outcome of critical care admission with an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.70–0.77), 76% sensitivity, and F-score of 0.56.  Conclusion: Predictive machine learning algorithms demonstrate excellent to good discriminative power to predict hospitalization and critical care admission, respectively. Administrators and clinicians could benefit from machine learning approaches to predict hospitalization and critical care admission, to optimize and allocate scarce ED and hospital resources and provide optimal care.

AB  - Background: Emergency departments across the globe follow a triage system in order to cope with overcrowding. The intention behind triage is to improve the emergency care and to prioritize cases in terms of clinical urgency.Discussion: In emergency department triage, medical care might lead to adverse consequences like delay in providing care, compromise in privacy and confidentiality, poor physician-patient communication, failing to provide the necessary care altogether, or even having to decide whose life to save when not everyone can be saved. These consequences challenge the ethical quality of emergency care. This article provides an ethical analysis of "routine" emergency department triage. The four principles of biomedical ethics - viz. respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice provide the starting point and help us to identify the ethical challenges of emergency department triage. However, they do not offer a comprehensive ethical view. To address the ethical issues of emergency department triage from a more comprehensive ethical view, the care ethics perspective offers additional insights.Summary: We integrate the results from the analysis using four principles of biomedical ethics into care ethics perspective on triage and propose an integrated clinically and ethically based framework of emergency department triage planning, as seen from a comprehensive ethics perspective that incorporates both the principles-based and care-oriented approach. © 2011 Aacharya et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Overcrowding is a challenge for emergency departments throughout the world. Triage systems categorize the patients based on medical emergencies in order to avoid the malpractices. The present study aimed to test the validity of an articial intelligence tool, 'Decision Trees', in emergency medicine triage. Methods: This prospective, cross-sectional, clinical study was conducted in an emergency department of a tertiary care hospital. A total of 1999 patients over 18 years were included into the study. The triage stuff were trained before the study with the Australasian Triage Scale. Two independent observers rate the ultimate triage category of study patients. A new algorithym by 'Decision Trees' was constructed at the end of the study. Results: The mean age of the study patients were 41.1±17,2 and 49.1 % of them (n=981) were male. There were 867 patients (43.3%) with triage category of ve and 14 (0.7%) patients with triage category one. The most common clinical descriptors of the patients were minimal pain with no high risk features 20.5% of them (n=409) and minor symptoms of low risk conditions 18.1% of them (n=362). There was an excellent consistency between two independent observers (kappa value: 0.997. The new algorithm by 'Decision Trees' rated wrong in only one patient. The accuracy rate was 99.9%. The consistency between ATS and 'Decision Trees was excellent (kappa value: 0.999). There was average consistency between physicians and paramedics. (kappa value: 0.541). Conclusion: Decision trees as an articial intelligence model should be used for producing practical triage algorithms as a decision support tool in emergency departments.

AB  - The purpose of triage is to prevent the delay of treatment for patients in real emergencies due to excessive numbers of patients in the hospital. This study uses the data of patients of consistent triage to develop the triage prediction model. By integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the anomaly detection (overestimate and underestimate) prediction accuracy rate can be 100 %, which is better than the accuracy rate of SVM (about 89.2 %) or Back- propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) (96.71 %); afterwards, this study uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) to adopt Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine three SVR parameters to predict triage. After using the scroll data predictive values, we calculate the Absolute Percentage Error (APE) of each scroll data. The resulting SVR's Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is 3.78 %, and BPNN's MAPE is 5.99 %; therefore, the proposed triage prediction model of this study can effectively predict anomaly detection and triage. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Introduction: Emergency Department (ED) crowding is an intensifying crisis. While input, throughput, and output factors all contribute to crowding, throughput factors are the most dependent on ED staff and process. Diagnostic testing is a fundamental ED process that has not been systematically evaluated. We present a systematic review of interventions designed to reduce ED length of stay (LOS) by optimizing laboratory or imaging turnaround time, or by introducing point-of-care testing (POCT). Methods: We conducted systematic database searches in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials without filters or language restrictions, of all interventions on diagnostic technology that affected ED throughput (PROSPERO:CRD42019125651). Studies were screened by two independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane ROB-2 tools for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute tool for all other study designs. Results: 18 studies met inclusion criteria (Cohen's kappa = 0.69). Study results were not pooled due to high statistical heterogeneity as assessed by chi-squared and I-squared statistics. 12 POCT intervention studies reported LOS changes ranging from-114 to + 8 minutes (-26.8% to + 3.8%), although three were non-significant findings. Four studies that initiated POCT or lab-ordering at triage reported LOS reductions ranging from 22 to 174 minutes, but only one of these, at 29 minutes (16%), was statistically significant. One study of improved laboratory troponin processing reported a LOS reduction of 43 minutes (12.3%). Another, which allowed triage nurses to order ankle x-rays using the Ottawa ankle rules, reported a non-significant LOS reduction of 28 minutes for patients with ankle injuries. LOS improvements reflected the population of patients who underwent the testing modality, rather than overall ED LOS. Seven studies had low risk of bias, 11 studies had some risk of bias, and no studies had high risk of bias (Cohen's kappa = 0.58). Conclusion: Eleven of 18 diagnostic testing studies reported LOS reductions. POCT was the most common intervention type, and usually reduced EDLOS within relevant patient subsets, while triage-initiated testing generally did not. To aid widespread adoption, future research should focus on interrupted time series or RCT designs, and more comprehensive descriptions of the contextual factors affecting implementation of these interventions.

AB  - Chemical Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI) place a heavy burden on hospital staff and resources. Machine Learning (ML) tools can provide efficient decision support to caregivers. However, ML models require large volumes of data for the most accurate results, which is typically not feasible in the chaotic nature of a chemical MCI. This study examines the application of four statistical dimension reduction techniques: Random Selection, Covariance/Variance, Pearson's Linear Correlation, and Principle Component Analysis to reduce a dataset of 311 hazardous chemicals and 79 related signs and symptoms (SSx). An Artificial Neural Network pipeline was developed to create comparative models. Results show that the number of signs and symptoms needed to determine a chemical culprit can be reduced to nearly 40 SSx without losing significant model accuracy. Evidence also suggests that the application of dimension reduction methods can improve ANN model performance accuracy.

AB  - Human coders, in many organizations conducting injury surveillance, routinely assign External-cause-of-injury codes (E-codes) to short narratives describing the incident, transcribed by triage nurses or others in hospital emergency rooms or other settings. Machine learning (ML) models trained on coded injury narratives can accurately assign E-codes to a large portion of the data, but tend to poorly predict cases falling into rare categories. In this study, we examined several ways of filtering out cases for human review that were likely to belong to rare categories from the predictions of Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes classifiers for a manually-coded emergency department triage dataset of approximately 500,000 cases, collected between years 2002-2012, provided by the Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit. The ML models were trained using 90% of the data and the filtering approaches were evaluated on a prediction set comprised of the remaining cases. Cost analysis was also performed to compare the efficiency of each filtering method. The results showed that each filtering method greatly improved the ability to detect rare categories. Filtering using expert-designed causal linguistic rules combined with Logistic Regression prediction strength was found to be the most efficient approach. Several completely automated filtering approaches were also found to be effective.

AB  - In a mass casualty incident, the factors that determine the survival rate of injured patients are diverse, but one of the key factors is the time for triage. Additionally, the main factor that determines the time of triage is the number of medical personnel. However, when relying on a small number of medical personnel, the ability to increase survivability is limited. Therefore, developing a classification model for survival prediction that can quickly and precisely triage via wearable devices without medical personnel is important. In this study, we designed a consciousness index to substitute the factor by manpower and improved the classification accuracy by applying a machine learning algorithm. First, logistic regression analysis using vital signs and a consciousness index capable of remote monitoring through wearable devices confirmed the high efficiency of the consciousness index. We then developed a classification model with high accuracy which corresponds to existing injury severity scoring systems through the machine learning algorithms. We extracted 460,865 cases which met our criteria for developing the survival prediction from the national sample project in the national trauma databank which contains 408,316 cases of blunt injury and 52,549 cases of penetrating injury. Among the dataset, 17,918 (3.9%) cases died while the other survived. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the different models with the proposed simplified consciousness score as follows: RTS (as baseline), 0.78 (95% CI = 0.775 to 0.785); logistic regression, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.862 to 0.870); random forest, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.862 to 0.872); deep neural network, 0.89 (95% CI = 0.882 to 0.890). As a result, we confirmed the possibility of remote triage using a wearable device. It is expected that the time required for triage can be effectively reduced by using the developed classification model of survival prediction.

AB  - Background: Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a host response to infection. The quick SOFA (qSOFA) score has been recently proposed as a new bedside clinical score to identify patients with suspected infection at risk of complication (intensive care unit (ICU) admission, in-hospital mortality). The aim of this study was to measure the sensitivity of the qSOFA score, SIRS criteria and sepsis definitions to identify the most serious sepsis cases in the prehospital setting and at the emergency department (ED) triage. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of all patients transported by emergency medical services (EMS) to the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) over twelve months. All patients with a suspected or proven infection after the ED workup were included. We retrospectively analysed the sensitivity of the qSOFA score (≥2 criteria), SIRS criteria (≥2 clinical criteria) and sepsis definition (SIRS criteria + one sign of organ dysfunction or hypoperfusion) in the pre-hospital setting and at the ED triage as predictors of ICU admission, ICU stay of ≥3 days and early (i.e. 48 h) mortality. No direct comparison between the three tools was attempted. Results: Among 11,411 patients transported to the University hospital, 886 (7.8%) were included. In the pre-hospital setting, the sensitivity of qSOFA reached 36.3% for ICU admission, 17.4% for ICU stay of three days or more and 68.0% for 48 h mortality. The sensitivity of SIRS criteria reached 68.8% for ICU admission, 74.6% for ICU stay of three days or more and 64.0% for 48 h mortality. The sensitivity of sepsis definition did not reach 60% for any outcome. At ED triage, the sensitivity of qSOFA reached 31.2% for ICU admission, 30.5% for ICU stay of ≥3 days and 60.0% for mortality at 48 h. The sensitivity of SIRS criteria reached 58.8% for ICU admission, 57.6% for ICU stay of ≥3 days 80.0% for mortality at 48 h. The sensitivity of sepsis definition reached 60.0% for 48 h mortality. Discussion: Incidence of sepsis in the ED among patients transported by ambulance was 3.8 percent. This rate, associated to the mortality of sepsis, confirms the necessity to dispose of a test to early identify those patients. Conclusion: The sensitivity performance of all three tools was suboptimal. The qSOFA score, SIRS criteria and sepsis definition have low identification sensitivity in selecting septic patients in the pre-hospital setting or upon arrival in the ED at risk of complication.

Triage is an initial classification of emergency department (ED) patients, according to the severity level of their medical condition. The need of fast and accurate triage decision-making, lead to the development of widely used triage algorithms, such as ESI (Emergency Severity Index).Observations and interviews with triage personnel exposed difficulties of triage process and helped us create an ESI-based decision making model. Next, we built a multiple-choice questioner to characterize the application and required features. 40 triage nurses completed the questioner. Results indicated that the most highly requested feature was an automated severity grade calculator, which became the core of the proposed design.While current design focuses on the analytical decision model, statistical analysis of the questioner results indicated that it is often insufficient when facing medical reality complexities, dictating nurse’s frequent use of intuition. Using triage systems data analysis and modern machine-learning methodologies, we inspire to develop a second version of the application that will integrate intuitive insights into triage scale algorithmic decision process.

AB  - Background: Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) comprises a complex and potentially fatal group of conditions requiring emergency specialist management. The aim of this study was to build a prediction algorithm to assist prehospital triage of AAS. Methods: Details of consecutive patients enrolled in a regional specialist aortic network were collected prospectively. Two prediction algorithms for AAS based on logistic regression and an ensemble machine learning method called SuperLearner (SL) were developed. Undertriage was defined as the proportion of patients with AAS not transported to the specialist aortic centre, and overtriage as the proportion of patients with alternative diagnoses but transported to the specialist aortic centre. Results: Data for 976 hospital admissions between February 2010 and June 2017 were included; 609 (62⋅4 per cent) had AAS. Overtriage and undertriage rates were 52⋅3 and 16⋅1 per cent respectively. The population was divided into a training cohort (743 patients) and a validation cohort (233). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values for the logistic regression score and the SL were 0⋅68 (95 per cent c.i. 0⋅64 to 0⋅72) and 0⋅87 (0⋅84 to 0⋅89) respectively (P < 0⋅001) in the training cohort, and 0⋅67 (0⋅60 to 0⋅74) and 0⋅73 (0⋅66 to 0⋅79) in the validation cohort (P = 0⋅038). The logistic regression score was associated with undertriage and overtriage rates of 33⋅7 (bootstrapped 95 per cent c.i. 29⋅3 to 38⋅3) and 7⋅2 (4⋅8 to 9⋅8) per cent respectively, whereas the SL yielded undertriage and overtriage rates of 1⋅0 (0⋅3 to 2⋅0) and 30⋅2 (25⋅8 to 34⋅8) per cent respectively. Conclusion: A machine learning prediction model performed well in discriminating AAS and could be clinically useful in prehospital triage of patients with suspected AAS.

AB  - Problem Statement: Improper triage and prioritization of big-data patients may result in erroneous strategic decisions. An example of such wrong decision making includes the triage of patients with chronic heart disease to low-priority groups. Incorrect decisions may jeopardize the patients' health. Objective: This study aims to evaluate and score the big data of patients with chronic heart disease and of those who require urgent attention. The assessment is based on multicriteria decision making in a telemedical environment to improve the triage and prioritization processes. Methods: A hands-on study was performed. A total of 500 patients with chronic heart disease manifested in di®erent symptoms and under various emergency levels were evaluated on the basis of the following four main measures. An electrocardiogram sensor was used to measure the electrical signals of the contractile activity of the heart over time. A SpO 2 sensor was employed to determine the blood oxygen saturation levels of the patients. A blood pressure sensor was used to obtain the physiological data of the systolic and diastolic blood pressures of the patients. Finally, a non-sensory measurement (text frame) was conducted to assess chest pain and breathing. The patients were prioritized on the basis of a set of measurements by utilizing integrated back-forward adjustment for weight computation and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. Discussion Results: Patients with the most urgent cases were given the highest priority level, whereas those with the least urgent cases were assigned with the lowest priority level among all patients' scores. The ¯rst three patients assigned to the medical committee of doctors were proven to be the most critical emergency cases with the highest priority level on the basis of their clinical symptoms. By contrast, the last three patients were proven to be the least critical emergency cases and given the lowest priority levels relative to other patients. The throughput measurement in terms of scalability based on our proposed algorithm was more e±cient than that of the benchmark algorithm. Finally, the new method for determining the \big data" patients characteristics based on \4Vs" was suggested.

AB  - Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems which are capable of doing human intelligence tasks such as decision making and problem solving. AI-based tools have been used for predicting various factors in medicine including risk stratification, diagnosis and choice of treatment. AI can also be of considerable help in emergency departments, especially patients' triage. Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the application of AI in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain to estimate emergency severity index version 4 (ESI-4) score without the estimate of the required resources. Methods: A mixed-model approach was used for predicting the ESI-4 score. Seventy percent of the patient cases were used for training the models and the remaining 30% for testing the accuracy of the models. During the training phase, patients were randomly selected and were given to systems for analysis. The output, which was the level of triage, was compared with the gold standard (emergency medicine physician). During the test phase of the study, another group of randomly selected patients were evaluated by the systems and the results were then compared with the gold standard. Results: Totally, 215 patients who were triaged by the emergency medicine specialist were enrolled in the study. Triage Levels 1 and 5 were omitted due to low number of cases. In triage Level 2, all systems showed fair level of prediction with Neural Network being the highest. In Level 3, all systems again showed fair level of prediction. However, in triage Level 4, decision tree was the only system with fair prediction. Conclusion: The application of AI in triage of patients with acute abdominal pain resulted in a model with acceptable level of accuracy. The model works with optimized number of input variables for quick assessment.

AB  - Background: In the emergency department, it is important to identify and prioritize who requires an urgent intervention in a short time. Triage helps recognize the urgency among patients. An accurate triage decision helps patients receive the emergency service in the most appropriate time. Various triage systems have been developed and verified to assist healthcare providers to make accurate triage decisions. The triage accuracy can represent the quality of emergency service, but there is a lack of review studies addressing this topic. Methods: A literature search was conducted in four electronic databases where 'emergency nursing' and 'triage accuracy' were used as keywords. Studies published from 2008 January to 2018 August were included as potential subjects. Nine studies were included in this review after the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Results: Written case scenarios and retrospective review were commonly used to examine the triage accuracy. The triage accuracy from studies was in moderate level. The single-center studies which held better results than those from multi-center studies revealed the need of triage training and consistent training between emergency departments. Conclusions: Regular refresher triage training, collaboration between emergency departments and continuous monitoring were necessary to strengthen the use of triage systems and improve nurse's triage performance.

AB  - Background: The Sydney Triage to Admission Risk Tool (START) is a validated clinical analytics tool designed to estimate the probability of in-patient admission based on Emergency Department triage characteristics. Methods: This was a single centre pilot implementation study using a matched case control sample of patients assessed at ED triage. Patients in the intervention group were identified at triage by the START tool as likely requiring in-patient admission and briefly assessed by an ED Consultant. Bed management were notified of these patients and their likely admitting team based on senior early assessment. Matched controls were identified on the same day of presentation if they were admitted to the same in-patient teams as patients in the intervention group and same START score category. Outcomes were ED length of stay and proportion of patients correctly classified as an in-patient admission by the START tool. Results: One hundred and thirteen patients were assessed using the START-based model of care. When compared with matched control patients, this intervention model of care was associated with a significant reduction in ED length of stay [301 min (IQR 225-397) versus 423 min (IQR 297-587) p < 0.001] and proportion of patients meeting 4 h length of stay thresholds increased from 24 to 45% (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this small pilot implementation study, the START tool, when used in conjunction with senior early assessment was associated with a reduction in ED length of stay. Further controlled studies are now underway to further examine its utility across other ED settings.

AB  - Emergency department (ED) crowding is a universal health issue that affects the efficiency of hospital management and patient care quality. ED crowding frequently occurs when a request for a ward-bed for a patient is delayed until a doctor makes an admission decision. In this case study, we build a classifier to predict the disposition of patients using manually typed nurse notes collected during triage as provided by the Alberta Medical Center. These predictions can potentially be incorporated to early bed coordination and fast track streaming strategies to alleviate overcrowding and waiting times in the ED. However, these triage notes involve high dimensional, noisy, and sparse text data, which make model-fitting and interpretation difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel semiorthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization for both continuous and binary predictors to reduce the dimensionality and derive word topics. The triage notes can then be interpreted as a non-subtractive linear combination of orthogonal basis topic vectors. Our real data analysis shows that the triage notes contain strong predictive information toward classifying the disposition of patients for certain medical complaints, such as altered consciousness or stroke. Additionally, we show that the document-topic vectors generated by our method can be used as features to further improve classification accuracy by up to 1% across different medical complaints, for example, 74.3%–75.3% accuracy for patients with stroke symptoms. This improvement could be clinically impactful for certain patients, especially when the scale of hospital patients is large. Furthermore, the generated word-topic vectors provide a bi-clustering interpretation under each topic due to the orthogonal formulation, which can be beneficial for hospitals in better understanding the symptoms and reasons behind patients’ visits. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - An unsuitable patient flow as well as prolonged waiting lists in the emergency room of a maternity unit, regarding gynecology and obstetrics care, can affect the mother and child’s health, leading to adverse events and consequences regarding their safety and satisfaction. Predicting the patients’ waiting time in the emergency room is a means to avoid this problem. This study aims to predict the pre-triage waiting time in the emergency care of gynecology and obstetrics of Centro Materno Infantil do Norte (CMIN), the maternal and perinatal care unit of Centro Hospitalar of Oporto, situated in the north of Portugal. Data mining techniques were induced using information collected from the information systems and technologies available in CMIN. The models developed presented good results reaching accuracy and specificity values of approximately 74% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, the number of patients and triage professionals working in the emergency room, as well as some temporal variables were identified as direct enhancers to the pre-triage waiting time. The implementation of the attained knowledge in the decision support system and business intelligence platform, deployed in CMIN, leads to the optimization of the patient flow through the emergency room and improving the quality of services.

AB  - Background: Disposition decisions are critical to the functioning of Emergency Departments. The objectives of the present study were to derive and internally validate a prediction model for inpatient admission from the Emergency Department to assist with triage, patient flow and clinical decision making. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of State-wide Emergency Department data in New South Wales, Australia. Adult patients (age ≥ 16 years) were included if they presented to a Level five or six (tertiary level) Emergency Department in New South Wales, Australia between 2013 and 2014. The outcome of interest was in-patient admission from the Emergency Department. This included all admissions to short stay and medical assessment units and being transferred out to another hospital. Analyses were performed using logistic regression. Discrimination was assessed using area under curve and derived risk scores were plotted to assess calibration. Results: 1,721,294 presentations from twenty three Level five or six hospitals were analysed. Of these 49.38% were male and the mean (sd) age was 49.85 years (22.13). Level 6 hospitals accounted for 47.70% of cases and 40.74% of cases were classified as an in-patient admission based on their mode of separation. The final multivariable model including age, arrival by ambulance, triage category, previous admission and presenting problem had an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81, 0.82). Conclusion: By deriving and internally validating a risk score model to predict the need for in-patient admission based on basic demographic and triage characteristics, patient flow in ED, clinical decision making and overall quality of care may be improved. Further studies are now required to establish clinical effectiveness of this risk score model.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate the potential of machine learning and capability of natural language processing (NLP) to predict disposition of patients based on triage notes in the ED. Methods: A retrospective cohort of ED triage notes from St Vincent's Hospital (Melbourne) was used to develop a deep-learning algorithm that predicts patient disposition. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a recent language representation model developed by Google, was utilised for NLP. Eighty percent of the dataset was used for training the model and 20% was used to test the algorithm performance. Ktrain library, a wrapper for TensorFlow Keras, was employed to develop the model. Results: The accuracy of the algorithm was 83% and the area under the curve was 0.88. Sensitivity, speci-ficity, precision and F1-score of the algorithm were 72%, 86%, 56% and 63%, respectively. Conclusion: Machine learning and NLP can be together applied to the ED triage note to predict patient disposition with a high level of accuracy. The algorithm can potentially assist ED clinicians in early identification of patients requiring admission by mitigating the cognitive load, thus optimises resource allocation in EDs.

AB  - Background: Before patients are admitted into the emergency department, it is important to undertake a pre-hospital process, both in terms of treatment performance and a request for resources from an emergency unit. The existing system to triage patients in Thailand is not functioning to its full capacity in either the primary medical system or pre-hospital treatment with shortcomings in the areas of speed, features, and appropriate systems. There is a high possibility of issuing a false Initial Dispatch Code (IDC), which will cause the over or underutilisation of emergency resources, such as rescue teams, community hospitals and emergency medical volunteers. Methods: A usability system design, together with a reliability test, was applied to develop an application to optimise the pre-hospital process, specifically to sort patients, using an IDC to improve the request for emergency resources. The triage mobile application was developed on both iOS and Android operating systems to support patient triage based on Criteria Based Dispatch (CBD). The 25 main symptom categories covered by CBD were used to design and develop the application, and 12 emergency medical staff, including doctors and nurses, were asked to test the system in the aspects of triage protocol correction, triage reliability, usability and user satisfaction. Results: The results of testing the proposed triage application were compared with the time used to triage by experienced staff and it was found that, in non-trauma cases, it was faster and more effective to use the application for emergency operations and to correct the IDC code representation. Conclusions: The triage application will be utilised to support the pre-hospital process and to classify patients' conditions before they are admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). The application is suitable for users who are not medical emergency staff. Patients with non-trauma symptoms may be a suitable group to use the application in terms of time used to identify IDC for their own symptoms. The use of the application can be beneficial for those who wish to self-identify their symptoms before requesting medical services.

AB  - Triage is a complex process in ED that necessitates accurate, consistent and timely decision for assessment and management of incoming patients. With triage officers having different levels of expertise and experience, the triage scales are applied inconsistently, as evident from the lack of uniformity in the existing triaging system in Malaysian hospitals. In many hospitals, the triaging largely occurs in an ad hoc basis, placing patients at risk and contributing to inefficient resource utilisation. A computer system can be used to overcome these problems. Consequently, the paper proposes the development of a knowledge-based, agent-oriented decision support system for triage assessment and management. The ability to implement goal-directed behaviour, communicative processes and schedule-oriented, but concurrently executed tasks among others, make the agent technology suitable to be applied. We intend to adopt a modelling view to knowledge engineering, and plan to use the CommonKADS methodology as a basis for knowledge engineering, modelling and knowledge base development. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Trauma triage seeks to match injured patients with appropriate healthcare resources. Mistriage can be costly both in terms of money and lives. This paper proposes and evaluates a comprehensive model that uses both machine learning and data mining to support the process of trauma triage. The proposed model is more dynamic and adaptive than the typical guideline-based approach, and it incorporates a computer-assisted feedback loop to support clinician efforts to improve triage accuracy. This paper uses three years of retrospective data to compare multiple machine learning algorithms to the current standard triage decision guidelines. Then, the triage classifications from one of those experiments are used as input to demonstrate the potential of our data mining algorithm to provide a mapping between patient type and classifier performance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Aim: To establish how the Manchester Triage System can correctly prioritize patients admitted to the emergency department for transitory loss of consciousness in relation to their risk of presenting severe acute disease. Design: A observational retrospective study. Methods: A total of 2291 patients who required a triage evaluation for a transitory loss of consciousness at the emergency department of Merano Hospital between 1 January 2017 and 30 June 2019 were considered. Transitory loss of consciousness was classified according to European Society of Cardiology guidelines. The baseline characteristics of the patients were collected and divided according to the priority level assigned at triage into two different study groups: high priority (red/orange) and low priority (blue/green/yellow). The composite outcome of the study was defined as the diagnosis of a severe acute disease. Results: Of the patients enrolled, 17% (390/2291) had a high-priority code and 83% (1901/2291) received a low-priority code. Overall, a severe acute disease was present in 16.9% of patients (387/2291). The Manchester Triage System had a sensitivity of 42.4%, a specificity of 88.1% and an accuracy of 80.4% for predicting severe acute disease. The discriminatory ability had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.651 (CI 95%: 0.618–0.685). Conclusions: Despite the good specificity, the low sensitivity does not currently allow the Manchester Triage System to completely exclude patients with a severe acute disease who presented in the emergency department for a transitory loss of consciousness. Therefore, it is important to develop precise nursing tools or assessments that can improve triage performance. Impact: The assessment of a complex symptom can create difficulties in the stratification of patients in triage, assigning low-priority codes to patients with a severe disease. Additional tools are needed to allow the correct triage assessment of patients presenting with transitory loss of consciousness.

AB  - Aims: To explore emergency nurses’ and physicians’ experience of collaboration and collective decision-making when triaging older Emergency Department patients within the interprofessional team triage system. Design: Qualitative. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven nurses and five physicians. Transcripts were analysed via Interpretive Description between September 2016–May 2017. Results: ‘Negotiating collaboration’ was developed as the main theme. Three subthemes influenced the negotiation process: Participants described divergent opinions on how an optimal triage system should work (‘preferences for triage systems’); they had conflicting perceptions of each profession's role (‘role perceptions’); and they expressed different coping strategies regarding ‘perceived time pressure’. The compatibility of participants’ views on these sub-themes determined whether the nurse and physician were able to successfully negotiate their collaboration. These themes became more evident when the team triaged older ED patients. Conclusion: Improving interprofessional team triage requires working with the involved nurses’ and physicians’ values and beliefs. The strengths of both professions need to be considered and a flexible approach to collaboration established according to the patients’ situations. Impact: Emergency Department leaders need to consider nurses’ and physicians’ values and beliefs to promote interprofessional collaboration in team triage.

AB  - Objectives: Our objective was to design and develop a mobile clinical decision support system for emergency triage of different acute pain presentations. The system should interact with existing hospital information systems, run on mobile computing devices (handheld computers) and be suitable for operation in weak-connectivity conditions (with unstable connections between mobile clients and a server). Methods: The MET (Mobile Emergency Triage) system was designed following an extended client-server architecture. The client component, responsible for triage decision support, is built as a knowledge-based system, with domain ontology separated from generic problem solving methods and used for the automatic creation of a user interface. Results: The MET system is well suited for operation in the Emergency Department of a hospital. The system's external interactions are managed by the server, while the MET clients, running on handheld computers are used by clinicians for collecting clinical data and supporting triage at the bedside. The functionality of the MET client is distributed into specialized modules, responsible for Waging specific types of acute pain presentations. The modules are stored on the server, and on request they can be transferred and executed on the mobile clients. The modular design provides for easy extension of the system's functionality. A clinical trial of the MET system validated the appropriateness of the system's design, and proved the usefulness and acceptance of the system in clinical practice. Conclusions: The MET system captures the necessary hospital data, allows for entry of patient information, and provides triage support. By operating on handheld computers, it fits into the regular emergency department workflow without introducing any hindrances or disruptions. It supports triage anytime and anywhere, directly at the point of care, and also can be used as an electronic patient chart, facilitating structured data collection. © 2005 Schattauer GmbH.

AB  - Manchester Triage System is an algorithmic standard designed to aid the triage nurse in choosing an appropriate triage category using a five-point scale. Many of the terms used in Manchester Triage algorithm to describe patients' symptoms and their urgency levels are imprecise and overlap making the system a good candidate for fuzzy modeling. The paper develops a dynamic fuzzy triage system based on the Manchester triage algorithm. The system severs as a decision aid for the triage nurse while allowing medical experts to configure the meaning of the linguistic terms using a fuzzy mouse.

AB  - Triage in emergency department (ED) is adopted procedure in several countries using different emergency severity index systems. The objective is to subdivide patients into categories of increasing acuity to allow for prioritization and reduce emergency department congestion. However, while several studies have focused on improving the triage system and managing medical resources, the classification of patients depends strongly on nurse’s subjective judgment and thus is prone to human errors. So, it is crucial to set up a system able to model, classify and reason about vague, incomplete and uncertain knowledge. Thus, we propose in this paper a novel fuzzy ontology based on a new Fuzzy Emergency Severity Index (F-ESI_2.0) to improve the accuracy of current triage systems. Therefore, we model some fuzzy relevant medical subdomains that influence the patient’s condition. Our approach is based on continuous structured and unstructured textual data over more than two years collected during patient visits to the ED of the Lille University Hospital Center (LUHC) in France. The resulting fuzzy ontology is able to model uncertain knowledge and organize the patient’s passage to the ED by treating the most serious patients first. Evaluation results shows that the resulting fuzzy ontology is a complete domain ontology which can improve current triage system failures.

AB  -  Background: Benefit of revascularization in acute ischemic stroke declines over time. Any delay in acute stroke care contributes to poor treatment outcome. We aimed to identify factors associated with the delay in the process of acute stroke triage.  Methods: All patients presented at the emergency room at the Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand under stroke fast track protocol (ASFP) from January 2015 to March 2017 were reviewed. Demographic data, stroke subtypes, time measures, initial NIHSS were recorded. Delay in triage was defined as either door to first physician > 10 minutes or door to activate stroke fast track > 15 minutes. Multivariable logistic regression model were performed to identify independent variables associated with triage delay.  Results: A total of 1,000 patients were enrolled under ASFP with a mean age of 63.5+15.3 years and 53.9% were male. Triage delay was found in 11.2%. Factors associated with a delay in stroke triage were inaccurate presenting symptom(s) OR17.69 (95% CI 10.86, 28.82), dizziness and dysphagia as an initial presentation OR 3.26 (95% CI 1.64, 6.48) and OR 8.02 (95% CI 1.31, 49.28) respectively and uncertain chief complaint OR 3.35 (95% CI 1.56, 7.19).  Conclusion: Unclear chief complaint, dizziness and vertigo as an initial symptoms and inaccurate presenting symptoms significantly associated with the delay in acute stroke triage in an emergency department. Further research is needed to clarify if strategic questioning could help nurses and ER physicians in reducing this delay.

AB  - Background: Despite its continued use in many low-volume emergency departments (EDs), 3-level triage systems have not been extensively studied, especially on live triage cases. We have modified from the Australasian Triage Scale and developed a 3-level triage scale, and sought to evaluate its validity, reliability, and over- and under-triage rates in real patient encounters in our setting. Method: This was a cross-sectional study in a single ED with 24,000 attendances per year. At triage, each patient was simultaneously assessed by a triage nurse, an adjudicator (the "criterion standard"), and a study nurse independently. Predictive validity was determined by comparing clinical outcomes, such as hospitalization, across triage levels. The discriminating performance of the triage tool in identifying patients requiring earlier medical attention was determined. Inter-observer reliability between the triage nurse and criterion standard, and across providers were determined using kappa statistics. Results: In total, 453 triage ratings of 151 triage cases, involving 17 ED triage nurses and 57 nurse pairs, were analysed. The proportion of hospital admission significantly increased with a higher triage rating. The performance of the scale in identifying patients requiring earlier medical attention was as follows: sensitivity, 68.2% (95% CI 45.1-86.1%); specificity, 99.2% (95% CI 95.8-100%); positive predictive value, 93.8% (95% CI 67.6-99.1%); and negative predictive value, 94.8% (95% CI 90.8-97.1%). The over-triage and under-triage rates were 0.7% and 4.6%, respectively. Agreement between the triage nurse and criterion standard was substantial (quadratic-weighted kappa = 0.76, 95% CI, 0.60-0.92, p < 0.001), so was the agreement across nurses (quadratic-weighted kappa = 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The 3-level triage system appears to have good validity and reasonable reliability in a low-volume ED setting. Further studies comparing 3-level and prevailing 5-level triage scales in live triage encounters and different ED settings are warranted.

AB  - We describe an intelligent triage system for emergency rooms; the system interacts with patients and classifies them by priority level and with respect to medical specialty. The system consists of a conversational interface, coupled with sensors and a physical robot-like platform, and classifiers that operate on symptoms and measurements so as to select a medical specialty and to output a priority level. Tests with human subjects demonstrated that our Healthbot system was well received and in fact preferred to alternatives. Tests have also shown that the classifiers reached accuracy consistent with a doctor's output.

AB  - Rationing of healthcare resources is a challenging decision that policy makers and providers may be forced to make during a pandemic, natural disaster, or mass casualty event. Well-defined guidelines to triage scarce life-saving resources must be designed to promote transparency, trust and consistency. To facilitate buy-in and use during high stress situations, these guidelines need to be inter-pretable and operational. We propose a novel data-driven model to compute interpretable triage guidelines based on policies for Markov Decision Process that can be represented as simple sequences of decision trees (tree policies). In particular, we characterize the properties of optimal tree policies and present an algorithm based on dynamic programming recursions to compute good tree policies. We utilize this methodology to obtain simple, novel triage guidelines for ventilator allocations for COVID-19 patients, based on real patient data from Montefiore hospitals. We also compare the performance of our guidelines to the official New York State guidelines that were developed in 2015 (well before the COVID-19 pandemic). Our empirical study shows that the number of excess deaths associated with ventilator shortages could be reduced significantly using our policy. Our work highlights the limitations of the existing official triage guidelines, which need to be adapted specifically to COVID-19 before being successfully deployed.

AB  - The excessive rate of patients arriving at accident and emergency centres is a major problem facing South African hospitals. Patients are prioritized for medical care through a triage process. Manual systems allow for inconsistency and error. This paper proposes a novel system to automate accident and emergency centre triage and uses this triage score along with an artificial intelligence estimate of patient-doctor time to optimize the queue order. A fuzzy inference system is employed to triage patients and a similar system estimates the time but adapts continuously through fuzzy Q-learning. The optimal queue order is found using a novel procedure based on genetic algorithms. These components are integrated in a simple graphical user interface. Live tests could not be performed but simulations reveal that the average waiting time can be reduced by 48 minutes and priority is given to urgent patients.

AB  - The Emergency Department of a medical center in Taiwan cooperated to conduct the research. A predictive model of triage system is contracted from the contract procedure, selection of parameters to sample screening. 2,000 pieces of data needed for the patients is chosen randomly by the computer. After three categorizations of data mining (Multi-group Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Back-propagation Neural Networks), it is found that Back-propagation Neural Networks can best distinguish the patients' extent of emergency, and the accuracy rate can reach to as high as 95.1%. The Back-propagation Neural Networks that has the highest accuracy rate is simulated into the triage acuity expert system in this research. Data mining applied to the predictive model of the triage acuity expert system can be updated regularly for both the improvement of the system and for education training, and will not be affected by subjective factors.

AB  - Abstract: Inadequate at-home management and self-awareness of heart failure (HF) exacerbations are known to be leading causes of the greater than 1 million estimated HF-related hospitalizations in the USA alone. Most current at-home HF management protocols include paper guidelines or exploratory health applications that lack rigor and validation at the level of the individual patient. We report on a novel triage methodology that uses machine learning predictions for real-time detection and assessment of exacerbations. Medical specialist opinions on statistically and clinically comprehensive, simulated patient cases were used to train and validate prediction algorithms. Model performance was assessed by comparison to physician panel consensus in a representative, out-of-sample validation set of 100 vignettes. Algorithm prediction accuracy and safety indicators surpassed all individual specialists in identifying consensus opinion on existence/severity of exacerbations and appropriate treatment response. The algorithms also scored the highest sensitivity, specificity, and PPV when assessing the need for emergency care. Lay summary: Here we develop a machine-learning approach for providing real-time decision support to adults diagnosed with congestive heart failure. The algorithm achieves higher exacerbation and triage classification performance than any individual physician when compared to physician consensus opinion.

AB  - Background: Changes to physiological parameters precede deterioration of ill patients. Early warning and track and trigger systems (TTS) use routine physiological measurements with pre-specified thresholds to identify deteriorating patients and trigger appropriate and timely escalation of care. Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are undiagnosed, undifferentiated and of varying acuity, yet the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using early warning systems and TTS in this setting is unclear. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on the use, development/validation, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of physiologically based early warning systems and TTS for the detection of deterioration in adult patients presenting to EDs. Methods: We searched for any study design in scientific databases and grey literature resources up to March 2016. Two reviewers independently screened results and conducted quality assessment. One reviewer extracted data with independent verification of 50% by a second reviewer. Only information available in English was included. Due to the heterogeneity of reporting across studies, results were synthesised narratively and in evidence tables. Results: We identified 6397 citations of which 47 studies and 1 clinical trial registration were included. Although early warning systems are increasingly used in EDs, compliance varies. One non-randomised controlled trial found that using an early warning system in the ED may lead to a change in patient management but may not reduce adverse events; however, this is uncertain, considering the very low quality of evidence. Twenty-eight different early warning systems were developed/validated in 36 studies. There is relatively good evidence on the predictive ability of certain early warning systems on mortality and ICU/hospital admission. No health economic data were identified. Conclusions: Early warning systems seem to predict adverse outcomes in adult patients of varying acuity presenting to the ED but there is a lack of high quality comparative studies to examine the effect of using early warning systems on patient outcomes. Such studies should include health economics assessments.

AB  - Emergency nurses often find themselves doing triage under time pressure and with only limited information, while the accuracy and rapidity of triage assessment may well determine a patient's safety. A question may emerge as to whether novice nurses, who may have lack of experience and knowledge, could deal with such a demanding practice. In response to this, equipping novice nurses with important aspects in triage decision-making processes is pivotal. The aim of this literature review is to identify elements that could be utilised as supports for novice nurses in developing their expertise of making decision in triage. This study employed CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO to find relevant articles, using search terms "triage", "decision-making", "clinical decision-making", combined with "expert", and "novice". The publication dates of those articles ranged from 1990 to 2015. 1487 articles was found and sorted based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in seventeen articles that had been used in this study. Literature review suggests four important elements for developing novices' expertise in triage decision making: understanding the difference of novices' and experts' performance, critical analysis on theoretical approaches of clinical decision-making processes, defining factors that may influence nurses' triage decision making, and using appropriate learning strategies.

AB  - A ustralians generally embrace online technology: in 2016-17, 86% of households had internet access 1 and about 89% of surveyed adults owned smartphones. 2 An abundance of material once accessible only to subject specialists is now more readily available on websites and via smart-phone applications (apps), and widespread internet access has changed health information-seeking behaviour. 3 About 80% of Australians report searching the internet for health information , and nearly 40% seek self-treatment advice online. 4,5 An Australian study 6 found that 34% of people attending emergency departments had searched the internet for information about their condition. Symptom checkers (SCs) are algorithm-based programs that provide potential diagnoses and triage advice. Medical students routinely use diagnostic apps to support their education, 7 and similar products are publicly available. SCs may not function as intended; they can encourage users to seek professional care even when self-care would be suitable, increasing the burden on health care systems. 8,9 Not all SCs are affiliated with reputable organisations, 3 and concerns have been raised about data security, privacy, the credentials of app authors and editors, and the accuracy of health information. 9,10 The United States Food and Drug Administration recently launched a voluntary software pre-certification program aimed at providing assurance of effectiveness and transparency of product performance and safety. 11 In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration oversees the regulation of medical software products and devices, but does not regulate SCs because they are not classified as medical devices. 12,13 Semigran and colleagues recently tested 23 free online SCs with standardised patient vignettes; they found that correct diagnoses headed the result list in 34% of evaluations, and appropriate triage advice was provided in 57% of cases. 8 In a study in a British primary care clinic, a self-assessment tool recommended a more urgent level of care than the general practitioner in 56% of cases and less urgent advice for only 5% of consultations. 14 The aim of our study was to investigate the diagnosis and triage performance of free SCs accessible in Australia. Methods Symptom checkers To identify the most prominent free online SCs in Australia, we searched for "symptom checker", "medical diagnosis", "health symptom diagnosis", "symptom", and "cough fever headache" (ie, flu-like symptoms) with five popular search engines (Google, Yahoo, Ask, Search Encrypt, Bing) between November 2018 and January 2019. The first three pages of results for each search engine were filtered to identify SCs that were publicly available, in English, for humans, and not restricted to specific medical conditions. The two major smartphone application distribution services (Google Play [Android] and App Store [Apple]) were also searched. As app store ranking algorithms place the most popular apps at the top of search results, 9 we included the first fifteen listed apps for each store. SCs were characterised as to whether they requested demographic information, by the number of diagnoses provided in responses, and by whether they claimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Patient vignettes To assess the diagnostic and triage performance of the SCs, 30 patient vignettes from the study by Semigran and colleagues 8 were adapted and supplemented by 18 new symptom-based scenarios , including several reflecting Australia-specific illnesses (Supporting Information, table 1). Clinical information for the Abstract Objectives: To investigate the quality of diagnostic and triage advice provided by free website and mobile application symptom checkers (SCs) accessible in Australia. Design: 36 SCs providing medical diagnosis or triage advice were tested with 48 medical condition vignettes (1170 diagnosis vignette tests, 688 triage vignette tests). Main outcome measures: Correct diagnosis advice (provided in first, the top three or top ten diagnosis results); correct triage advice (appropriate triage category recommended). Results: The 27 diagnostic SCs listed the correct diagnosis first in 421 of 1170 SC vignette tests (36%; 95% CI, 31-42%), among the top three results in 606 tests (52%; 95% CI, 47-59%), and among the top ten results in 681 tests (58%; 95% CI, 53-65%). SCs using artificial intelligence algorithms listed the correct diagnosis first in 46% of tests (95% CI, 40-57%), compared with 32% (95% CI, 26-38%) for other SCs. The mean rate of first correct results for individual SCs ranged between 12% and 61%. The 19 triage SCs provided correct advice for 338 of 688 vignette tests (49%; 95% CI, 44-54%). Appropriate triage advice was more frequent for emergency care (63%; 95% CI, 52-71%) and urgent care vignette tests (56%; 95% CI, 52-75%) than for non-urgent care (30%; 95% CI, 11-39%) and self-care tests (40%; 95% CI, 26-49%). Conclusion: The quality of diagnostic advice varied between SCs, and triage advice was generally risk-averse, often recommending more urgent care than appropriate. The known: Australians are searching the internet for health care advice with increasing frequency. Symptom checkers are common online tools for obtaining diagnostic and triage advice. The new: Thirty-six symptom checkers were evaluated with a range of clinical vignettes. The correct diagnosis was listed first in 36% of tests, and included among the first ten results in 58%; triage advice was appropriate in 49% of cases, including about 60% of emergency and urgent cases but only 30-40% of less serious case vignettes.

AB  - Background: One factor leading to the high mortality rate seen in sepsis is the subtle, dynamic nature of the disease, which can lead to delayed detection and under-resuscitation. This study investigated whether serial hemodynamic parameters obtained from a non-invasive cardiac output monitor (NICOM) predicts disease severity in patients at risk for sepsis. Methods: Prospective clinical trial of the NICOM device in a convenience sample of adult ED patients at risk for sepsis who did not have obvious organ dysfunction at the time of triage. Hemodynamic data were collected immediately following triage and 2 hours after initial measurement and compared in two outcome groupings: (1) admitted vs. dehydrated, febrile, hypovolemicdischarged patients; (2) infectious vs. non-infectious sources. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to determine whether the NICOM values predict hospital admission better than a serum lactate. Results: 50 patients were enrolled, 32 (64 %) were admitted to the hospital. Mean age was 49.5 (± 16.5) years and 62 % were female. There were no significant associations between changes in hemodynamic variables and patient disposition from the ED or diagnosis of infection. Lactate was significantly higher in admitted patients and those with infection (p = 0.01, p = 0.01 respectively). The area under the ROC [95 % Confidence Intervals] for lactate was 0.83 [0.64–0.92] compared to 0.59 [0.41–0.73] for cardiac output (CO), 0.68 [0.49–0.80] for cardiac index (CI), and 0.63 [0.36–0.80] for heart rate (HR) for predicting hospital admission. Conclusions: CO and CI, obtained at two separate time points, do not help with early disease severity differentiation of patients at risk for severe sepsis. Although mean HR was higher in those patients who were admitted, a serum lactate still served as a better predictor of patient admission from the ED.

AB  - Background: Demand for both the ambulance service and the emergency department (ED) is rising every year and when this demand is excessive in both systems, ambulance crews queue at the ED waiting to hand patients over. Some transported ambulance patients are 'low-acuity' and do not require the treatment of the ED. However, paramedics can find it challenging to identify these patients accurately. Decision support tools have been developed using expert opinion to help identify these low acuity patients but have failed to show a benefit beyond regular decision-making. Predictive algorithms may be able to build accurate models, which can be used in the field to support the decision not to take a low-acuity patient to an ED.

AB  - We report the preliminary data from a regional registry on ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary angioplasty in Apulia, Italy; the region is covered by a single public health-care service, a single public emergency medical service (EMS), and a single tele-medicine service provider. Two hundred and ninety-seven consecutive patients with STEMI transferred by regional free public EMS 1-1-8 for primary-PCI were enrolled in the study; 123 underwent pre-hospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) triage by tele-cardiology support and directly referred for primary-PCI, those remaining were just transferred by 1-1-8 ambulances for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (diagnosis not based on tele-medicine ECG; already hospitalised patients, emergency-room without tele-medicine support). Time from first ECG diagnostic for STEMI to balloon was recorded; a time-to-balloon <1 h was considered as optimal and patients as timely treated. Mean time-to-balloon with pre-hospital triage and tele-cardiology ECG was significantly shorter (0:41±0:17 vs 1:34±1:11 h, p<0.001, –0:53 h, –56%) and rates of patients timely treated higher (85% vs 35%, p<0.001, +141%), both in patients from the ‘inner’ zone closer to PCI catheterisation laboratories (0:34±0:13 vs 0:54±0:30 h, p<0.001; 96% vs 77%, p<0.01, +30%) and in the ‘outer’ zone (0:52±0:17 vs 1:41±1:14 h, p<0.001; 69% vs 29%, p<0.001, +138%). Results remained significant even after multivariable analysis (odds ratio for time-to-balloon 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63–0.80, p<0.001; 1.39, 95% CI 1.25–1.55, p<0.001, for timely primary-PCI). Pre-hospital triage with tele-cardiology ECG in an EMS registry from an area with more than one and a half million inhabitants was associated with shorter time-to-balloon and higher rates of timely treated patients, even in ‘rural’ areas. © 2014, The European Society of Cardiology.

AB  - Introduction: The presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease, COVID-19 has had an enormous impact on the operations of the emergency department (ED), particularly the triage area. The aim of the study was to derive and validate a prediction rule that would be applicable to Qatar's adult ED population to predict COVID-19-positive patients. Methods: This is a retrospective study including adult patients. The data were obtained from the electronic medical records (EMR) of the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) for three EDs. Data from the Hamad General Hospital ED were used to derive and internally validate a prediction rule (Q-PREDICT). The Al Wakra Hospital ED and Al Khor Hospital ED data formed an external validation set consisting of the same time frame. The variables in the model included the weekly ED COVID-19-positivity rate and the following patient characteristics: region (nationality), age, acuity, cough, fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and hypotension. All statistical analyses were executed with Stata 16.1 (Stata Corp). The study team obtained appropriate institutional approval. Results: The study included 45,663 adult patients who were tested for COVID-19. Out of these, 47% (n = 21461) were COVID-19 positive. The derivation- set model had very good discrimination (c = 0.855, 95% Confidence intervals (CI) 0.847- 0.861). Cross-validation of the model demonstrated that the validation-set model (c = 0.857, 95% CI 0.849-0.863) retained high discrimination. A high Q-PREDICT score (≥13) is associated with a nearly 6-fold increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 positive (likelihood ratio 5.9, 95% CI 5.6- 6.2), with a sensitivity of 84.7% (95% CI, 84.0%-85.4%). A low Q-PREDICT (≤6) is associated with a nearly 20-fold increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 negative (likelihood ratio 19.3, 95% CI 16.7-22.1), with a specificity of 98.7% (95% CI 98.5%-98.9%). Conclusion: The Q-PREDICT is a simple scoring system based on information readily collected from patients at the front desk of the ED and helps to predict COVID-19 status at triage. The scoring system performed well in the internal and external validation on datasets obtained from the state of Qatar.

AB  - SNS24 is a telephone service for triage, counselling, and referral service provided by the Portuguese National Health Service. Currently, following the predefined 59 Clinical Pathways, the selection of the most appropriate one is manually done by nurses. This paper presents a study on using automatic text classification to aid on the clinical pathway selection. The experiments were carried out on 3 months calls data containing 269,669 records and a selection of the best combination of ten text representations and four machine learning algorithm was pursued by building 40 different models. Then, fine-tuning of the algorithm parameters and the text embedding model were performed achieving a final accuracy of 78.80% and F1 of 78.45%. The best setup was then used to calculate the accuracy of the top-3 and top-5 most probable clinical pathways, reaching values of 94.10% and 96.82%, respectively. These results suggest that using a machine learning approach to aid the clinical triage in phone call services is effective and promising.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficiency, cost, and safety of a diagnostic strategy employing early coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) to a strategy employing rest-stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the evaluation of acute low-risk chest pain. Background: In the United States, >8 million patients require emergency department evaluation for acute chest pain annually at an estimated diagnostic cost of >$10 billion. Methods: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial in 16 emergency departments ran between June 2007 and November 2008. Patients were randomly allocated to CCTA (n = 361) or MPI (n = 338) as the index noninvasive test. The primary outcome was time to diagnosis; the secondary outcomes were emergency department costs of care and safety, defined as freedom from major adverse cardiac events in patients with normal index tests, including 6-month follow-up. Results: The CCTA resulted in a 54% reduction in time to diagnosis compared with MPI (median 2.9 h [25th to 75th percentile: 2.1 to 4.0 h] vs. 6.3 h [25th to 75th percentile: 4.2 to 19.0 h], p < 0.0001). Costs of care were 38% lower compared with standard (median $2,137 [25th to 75th percentile: $1,660 to $3,077] vs. $3,458 [25th to 75th percentile: $2,900 to $4,297], p < 0.0001). The diagnostic strategies had no difference in major adverse cardiac events after normal index testing (0.8% in the CCTA arm vs. 0.4% in the MPI arm, p = 0.29). Conclusions: In emergency department acute, low-risk chest pain patients, the use of CCTA results in more rapid and cost-efficient safe diagnosis than rest-stress MPI. Further studies comparing CCTA to other diagnostic strategies are needed to optimize evaluation of specific patient subsets.

AB  - A total of 93% of students said they would use Online Triage to save time, but also to get reassurance and save money. Additionally, 77% of patients said they were moderately, very, or extremely likely to use it next time they had a health problem. Compared to traditional triage using Online Triage resulted in a 31% reduction in nurse time. The CDS system was able to safely screen patients for potential emergencies, and improve safety over patient's predispositions. Nurses also reported a high degree of satisfaction with Online Triage and valued how it prepared them for patient interactions and reduced their documentation time. More work needs to be done improving the questionnaires, emergency screening, and display of information to nurses.

AB  - The distribution of illnesses reported by emergency departments from hospitals in a region under surveillance is particularly informative for the early detection of epidemics. The most direct source of data for construction of such a distribution is the final diagnoses of patients being seen in the emergency departments, but the delay in their availability impinges on the requirement that detection be timely. Free-text descriptions of patients' symptoms, called triage diagnoses, and ICD-9 values that encode the symptoms are entered when patients are admitted and, consequently, are timelier sources of data. An experiment to evaluate the accuracy of Bayesian classification of triage diagnoses into syndromes (i.e., illness categories) was performed, resulting in areas under the ROC curve (AUC) between .80 and .97 for the various syndromes. The classification accuracies using triage diagnoses surpass the classification accuracies using ICD-9 codes reported by previous studies. Triage diagnoses, therefore, are a more accurate source of data than ICD-9 codes for the early detection of epidemics.

AB  - A prompt severity assessment model of patients confirmed for having infectious diseases could enable efficient diagnosis while alleviating burden on the medical system. This study aims to develop a SARS-CoV-2 severity assessment model and establish a medical system that allows patients to check the severity of their cases and informs them to visit the appropriate clinic center based on past treatment data of other patients with similar severity levels. This paper provides the development processes of a severity assessment model using machine learning techniques and its application on SARS-CoV-2 patients. The proposed model is trained on a nationwide dataset provided by a Korean government agency and only requires patients' basic personal data, allowing them to judge the severity of their own cases. After modeling, the boosting-based decision tree model was selected as the classifier while mortality rate was interpreted as the probability score. The dataset was collected from all Korean citizens who were confirmed with COVID-19 between February, 2020 and July, 2021. The experiments achieved high model performance with an approximate precision of $0{\cdot}923$ and AUROC score of $0{\cdot}950$ [$95$% Tolerance Interval $0{\cdot}940$-$0{\cdot}958$, $95$% Confidence Interval $0{\cdot}949$-$0{\cdot}950$]. Moreover, our experiments identified the most important variables affecting the severity in the model via sensitivity analysis. The prompt severity assessment model for managing infectious people has been attained through using a nationwide dataset. It has demonstrated its superior performance by surpassing that of conventional risk assessments. With the model's high performance and easily accessible features, the triage algorithm is expected to be particularly useful when patients monitor their health status by themselves through smartphone applications.

AB  - We proposed TRISim, a multi-agent simulation tool, to study hospital triage operation methods. By inputting various combinations of model parameters, we can obtain the results to explore the correlation between parameters. We can derive an optimum set of parameters by exploring many parameters manually, but this is a time-consuming task. Herein, we propose Inverse TRISim, a method to automate the task of finding an optimal combination of parameters using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm.

AB  - Due to limited remote triage monitoring capabilities, combat medics cannot currently distinguish bleeding soldiers from those engaged in combat unless they have physical access to them. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that low-level physiological signals can be used to develop a machine-learning algorithm for tracking changes in central blood volume that will subsequently distinguish central hypovolemia from physical activity. Twenty-four subjects underwent central hypovolemia via lower body negative pressure (LBNP), and a supine-cycle exercise protocol. Exercise workloads were determined by matching heart rate responses from each LBNP level. Heart rate and stroke volume (SV) were measured via Finometer. ECG, heat flux, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and two-axis acceleration were obtained from an armband (SenseWear Pro2) and used to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict changes in SV as an index of central blood volume under both conditions. The algorithm SV was retrospectively compared against Finometer SV. A model was developed to determine whether unknown data points could be correctly classified into these two conditions using leave-one-out cross-validation. Algorithm vs. Finometer SV values were strongly correlated for LBNP in individual subjects (mean r = 0.92; range 0.75- 0.98), but only moderately correlated for exercise (mean r = 0.50; range -0.23- 0.87). From the first level of LBNP/exercise, the machine-learning algorithm was able to distinguish between LBNP and exercise with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all ≥90%). In conclusion, a machine-learning algorithm developed from low-level physiological signals could reliably distinguish central hypovolemia from exercise, indicating that this device could provide battlefield remote triage capabilities. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Objective: Roughly 5% to 10% of patients admitted to the emergency department suffer from acute abdominal pain. Triage plays a key role in patient stratification, identifying patients who need prompt treatment versus those who can safely wait. In this regard, the aim of this study was to estimate the performance of the Manchester Triage System in classifying patients with acute abdominal pain. Methods: A total of 9,851 patients admitted at the Emergency Department of the Merano Hospital with acute abdominal pain were retrospectively enrolled between 1 January 2017 and 30 June 2019. The study was conducted and reported according to the STROBE statement. The sensitivity and specificity of the Manchester Triage System were estimated by verifying the triage classification received by the patients and their survival at seven days or the need for acute surgery within 72 h after emergency department access. Results: Among the patients with acute abdominal pain (median age 50 years), 0.4% died within seven days and 8.9% required surgery within 72 hours. The sensitivity was 44.7% (29.9-61.5), specificity was 95.4% (94.9-95.8), and negative predictive value was 99.7% (99.2-100) in relation to death at seven days. Conclusions: The Manchester Triage System shows good specificity and negative pre-dictive value. However, its sensitivity was low due to the amount of incorrect triage prediction in patients with high-priority codes (red/orange), suggesting overtriage in relation to seven-day mortality. This may be a protective measure for the patient. In contrast, the need for acute surgery within 72 h was affected by under-triage. Relevance to clinical practice: The triage nurse using Manchester Triage System can correctly prioritise the majority of patients with acute abdominal pain, especially in low acuity patients. The Manchester Triage System is safe and does not underestimate the severity of the patients.

AB  - Background: Historically, limited sensitivity associated with traditional immunoassay methods has prevented the use of brain-specific proteins as blood biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) during triage, as these proteins exhibit low circulating concentrations. Digital ELISA is a newly-developed technique that is up to 1000 times more sensitive than conventional ELISA methods. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of digital ELISA over conventional ELISA improves the performance of brain-specific proteins as blood biomarkers of TBI during triage. Methods: Blood was sampled from TBI patients (n = 13) at emergency department admission, as well as from neurologically normal controls (n = 72). Serum levels of two brain-specific proteins, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and Tau, were measured via digital ELISA. Estimated conventional ELISA measures were generated by adjusting values according to the lower limits of detection achievable with commercially available conventional ELISA assays, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the diagnostic performance of digital ELISA measures to estimated conventional ELISA measures in terms of their ability to discriminate between TBI patients and controls. Results: Used in combination, digital ELISA measures of NfL and Tau could discriminate between groups with 100% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. Estimated conventional ELISA measures could only discriminate between groups with 7.7% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity. This difference in diagnostic performance was statistically significant when comparing areas under ROC curves. Conclusions: The use of digital ELISA over conventional ELISA methods improves the diagnostic performance of circulating brain-specific proteins for detection of TBI during triage.

AB  - Background: The association between palliative care and life-sustaining treatment following emergency department (ED) resuscitation is unclear. This study aims to analyze the usage of palliative care and life-sustaining treatments among ED triage level I resuscitation patients based on a nationally representative sample of patients in Taiwan. Methods: A matched-pair retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the association between palliative care and outcome variables using multivariate logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Between 2009 and 2013, 336 ED triage level I resuscitation patients received palliative care services (palliative care group) under a universal health insurance scheme. Retrospective cohort matching was performed with those who received standard care at a ratio of 1:4 (usual care group). Outcome variables included the number of visits to emergency and outpatient departments, hospitalization duration, total medical expenses, utilization of life-sustaining treatments, and duration of survival following ED triage level I resuscitation. Results: The mean survival duration following level I resuscitation was less than 1 year. Palliative care was administered to 15% of the resuscitation cohort. The palliative care group received significantly less life-sustaining treatment than did the usual care group. Conclusion: Among patients who underwent level I resuscitation, palliative care was inversely correlated with the scope of life-sustaining treatments. Furthermore, triage level I resuscitation status may present a possible new field for starting palliative care intervention and reducing low-value care.

AB  - Purpose: Non-contrast CT head scans provide rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute head injury; however, increased utilisation of CT head scans makes it difficult to prioritise acutely unwell patients and places pressure on busy emergency departments (EDs). This study validates an AI algorithm to triage patients presenting with Intracranial Haemorrhage (ICH) or Acute Infarct whilst also identifying a subset of patients as Normal, with the potential to function as a rule-out test. Methods: In total, 390 CT head scans were collected from 3 institutions in the UK, US and India. Ground-truth labels were assigned by 3 FRCR consultant radiologists. AI performance, as well as the performance of 3 independent radiologists, was measured against ground-truth labels. Results: The algorithm showed AUC values of 0.988 (0.978–0.994), 0.933 (0.901–0.961) and 0.939 (0.919–0.958) for ICH, Acute Infarct and Normal, respectively. Sensitivity/specificity for ICH and Acute Infarct were 0.988/0.925 and 0.833/0.927, respectively, compared to 0.907/0.991 and 0.618/0.977 for radiologists. AI rule-out of Normal scans achieved 0.93% negative predictive value (NPV) for the removal of 54.3% of Normal cases, compared to 86.8% NPV for radiologists. Conclusion: We show our algorithm can provide effective triage of ICH and Acute Infarct to prioritise acutely unwell patients. AI can also benefit clinical accuracy, with the algorithm identifying 91.3% of radiologist false negatives for ICH and 69.1% for Acute Infarct. Rule-out of Normal scans has huge potential for workload management in busy EDs, in this case removing 27.4% of all scans with no acute findings missed.

AB  - Triage in emergency departments is often complex and subject to conditions of uncertainty. The need for timely and accurate clinical assessment based on restricted and ambiguous information; the need to be consistent with standard triage scale and the stressful environment contribute to complexity and uncertainty of triage decision-making. This paper proposes a model for mobile decision support that aims at assisting the nurse when determining treatment category of a triage patient. Our model integrates soft computing and mobile computing technologies to provide intelligent decision support. The paper describes the model and prototype implementation of the model.

AB  - Healthcare organizations often benefit from information technologies as well as embedded decision support systems, which improve the quality of services and help preventing complications and adverse events. In Centro Materno Infantil do Norte (CMIN), the maternal and perinatal care unit of Centro Hospitalar of Oporto (CHP), an intelligent pre-triage system is implemented, aiming to prioritize patients in need of gynaecology and obstetrics care in two classes: urgent and consultation. The system is designed to evade emergency problems such as incorrect triage outcomes and extensive triage waiting times. The current study intends to improve the triage system, and therefore, optimize the patient workflow through the emergency room, by predicting the triage waiting time comprised between the patient triage and their medical admission. For this purpose, data mining (DM) techniques are induced in selected information provided by the information technologies implemented in CMIN. The DM models achieved accuracy values of approximately 94% with a five range target distribution, which not only allow obtaining confident prediction models, but also identify the variables that stand as direct inducers to the triage waiting times.

AB  - Manchester Triage System is a reliable system of triage in the emergency department of a hospital. This system when applied to a specific patients' condition such the pregnancy has several limitations. To overcome those limitations an alternative triage IDSS was developed in the MJD. In this approach the knowledge was obtained directly from the doctors' empirical and scientific experience to make the first version of decision models. Due to the particular gynecological and/or obstetrics requests other characteristics had been developed, namely a system that can increase patient safety for women in need of immediate care and help low-risk women avoid high-risk care, maximizing the use of resources. This paper presents the arrival flowchart, the associated decisions and the knowledge acquisition cycle. Results showed that this new approach enhances the efficiency and the safety through the appropriate use of resources and by assisting the right patient in the right place. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Introduction: ELISA (Echelle Liegeoise d'Index de Severite a l'Admission) is a valid new Emergency Department (ED) triage algorithm including five levels of categorisation (from U1, high emergency degree, to U5, low degree), based on vital signs and selected anamnestic data. Previous work has demonstrated that ELISA evidenced a strong interrater and intra-rater agreement [1]. In this study, we aimed at further evaluating its efficiency. Methods: From March 2008 to May 2008, we prospectively investigated 545 consecutive admissions to study the potential correlation between ELISA score and impact on resource consumption as well as ED stay. Resources were classified following three categories: complementary examinations (ECG, blood analysis, X-ray, and so forth), medical treatments (i.v. medications, casts, sutures, and so forth), and outcome after ED admission (discharge, hospitalisation, ICU admission or death). Each resource was considered a binary variable and was analyzed owing to four statistical tests: chi-square, Wald Wolfowitz, Kolmogorov- Smirnov and Mann-Whitney. Results: Statistical analysis evidenced an eff ect of ELISA score on the overall need for complementary examinations except for serology, X-rays and Holter ECG. The initial index severity had also related the need for urgent treatments. Outcomes were also significantly correlated with ELISA: the smaller the index, the bigger the number of hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths. This study demonstrates ELISA's efficiency; when the initial severity index is close to U1, more complementary examinations are needed and more medical treatments are necessary. Wounds do not have a high emergency degree, which explains why there was no influence of initial index severity on the realisation of sutures. The same reasoning is applied to X-rays that are frequently requested for light traumatic cases with low emergency degree. Finally, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death are more frequent when the ELISA score evidences the highest emergency degree. Conclusions: In addition to previous work demonstrating a strong inter-rater and intra-rater agreement, the present study points out the potent efficiency of ELISA, allowing its further use in the ED.

AB  - Medical institutions face serious problems, such as growing elderly population and lack of doctors. Telemedicine and remote health monitoring system (RHMS) intend to tackle these problems by slightly shortening hospital stays. RHMS reduces the burden on patients with primary care and improves communication among different health units to reduce the burden on emergency departments. Several healthcare studies have attempted to replace hospital visits with RHMS to deliver triage and prioritisation for patients because of considerable advances in wireless information communication and signal-processing technology. The process of medical triage determines the severity of a patient’s situation, whilst prioritisation is carried out to provide healthcare services for patients in due course to save their lives. An essential investigation is required to highlight the drawbacks of the current situation of patient triage and prioritisation over telemedicine environment. In this paper, a systematic review of medical emergency triage and patient prioritisation in a telemedicine environment was presented on the basis of two critical directions. Firstly, previous studies on patient triage and prioritisation in such an environment were collected, analysed and categorised. Secondly, many standards and guidelines of triage and different methods and techniques of prioritisation were presented and reviewed in detail. The following results were obtained: (1) The limitations and problems of existing patient triage and prioritisation methods were presented and emphasised. (2) The combination of triage and prioritisation of patients with chronic heart disease was not presented. (3) A framework based on evidence theory and integration of multilayer analytical hierarchy process and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution methods can be used in the future in order to triage chronic heart disease patients into different emergency levels and prioritise many patients to receive emergency and treatment-based services.

AB  - Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) is a soft computing technique that has successfully been used to model complex systems and to develop Medical Decision Support Systems for many medical discipline applications. FCMs have a great ability to handle complexity, uncertainty and abstract inference as is the case in the health care sector. In this work a Hierarchical structure is introduced within an integrated health system where the Supervisor is modelled as an abstract FCM to support the triaging procedure. At the lower level, the FCM-ESI DSS is used to estimate the Triage ESI level of every patient. This FCM-ESI DSS is developed based on a novel approach, which ensures a high degree of inferring from human experts.

AB  - Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, risk stratification has been used to decide patient eligibility for inpatient, critical and domiciliary care. Here, we sought to validate the MSL-COVID-19 score, originally developed to predict COVID-19 mortality in Mexicans. Also, an adaptation of the formula is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 severity in a triage setting (Nutri-CoV). Methods We included patients evaluated from March 16th to August 17th, 2020 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición, defining severe COVID-19 as a composite of death, ICU admission or requirement for intubation (n = 3,007). We validated MSL-COVID-19 for prediction of mortality and severe disease. Using Elastic Net Cox regression, we trained (n = 1,831) and validated (n = 1,176) a model for prediction of severe COVID-19 using MSLCOVID- 19 along with clinical assessments obtained at a triage setting. Results The variables included in MSL-COVID-19 are: pneumonia, early onset type 2 diabetes, age > 65 years, chronic kidney disease, any form of immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, diabetes, and age <40 years. MSL-COVID-19 had good performance to predict COVID-19 mortality (c-statistic = 0.722, 95%CI 0.690-0.753) and severity (c-statistic = 0.777, 95%CI 0.753-0.801). The Nutri-CoV score includes the MSL-COVID-19 plus respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. This tool had better performance in both training (c-statistic = 0.797, 95%CI 0.765-0.826) and validation cohorts (c-statistic = 0.772, 95%CI 0.0.745-0.800) compared to other severity scores. Conclusions MSL-COVID-19 predicts inpatient COVID-19 lethality. The Nutri-CoV score is an adaptation of MSL-COVID-19 to be used in a triage environment. Both scores have been deployed as web-based tools for clinical use in a triage setting. Copyright:

AB  - The triage of outpatient department is a vital process to screen patients. In addition, assessing the emergency case by the outpatient department can determine the quality of service. In emergency case, the patients have to be treated as soon as they arrive. If the triage of this case is delayed and the patients have major symptoms, it may develop serious complications leading to the cause of death or disability. Accordingly, assessing and making triage decisions, and assigning the level of patient acuity require being accurate, rapid and trustworthy in order to take care and treat them in time. Due to the fact that nowadays there is only one nurse on duty for the triage, he or she cannot well handle a bunch of patients arriving for treatment. According to Hospital and Healthcare Standards, 4th edition, the Healthcare Accreditation Institute (Public Organization) allows the use of technology to improve hospital services. This research aims to develop an intelligent triage assistant. To help the process by making triage decisions for all the patients promptly, assigning an acuity level and screening and assigning the patients to an area based on acuity. If unsuitable results happen, the triage nurse can be on duty promptly. Our intelligent triage assistant has been implemented using Visual Studio C#, Microsoft SQL Server for the database, and QnA Maker for the knowledge base. The application has been tested by outpatient nurses. They are quite satisfied with the primary outcome and recommend further improvements for future work.

AB  - All software written even today has bugs or defects. It is critical to fix bugs as quickly and efficiently as possible. Triaging bugs can be time-consuming, especially on larger teams or with larger projects. The process of assigning bugs to the proper developer is a task that can easily be automated and is a good exercise for using Machine Learning concepts. We will be studying sample data from the Google Chromium project using Machine Learning to analyze bugs by title and description to determine the best owner of a defect. We will use Natural Language Processing to analyze the bug title and description, looking for patterns to determine the correct developers to assign to bugs.

AB  - Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, risk stratification has been used to decide patient eligibility for inpatient, critical and domiciliary care. Here, we sought to validate the MSL-COVID-19 score, originally developed to predict COVID-19 mortality in Mexicans. Also, an adaptation of the formula is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 severity in a triage setting (Nutri-CoV). Methods We included patients evaluated from March 16th to August 17th, 2020 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición, defining severe COVID-19 as a composite of death, ICU admission or requirement for intubation (n = 3,007). We validated MSL-COVID-19 for prediction of mortality and severe disease. Using Elastic Net Cox regression, we trained (n = 1,831) and validated (n = 1,176) a model for prediction of severe COVID-19 using MSLCOVID- 19 along with clinical assessments obtained at a triage setting. Results The variables included in MSL-COVID-19 are: pneumonia, early onset type 2 diabetes, age > 65 years, chronic kidney disease, any form of immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, diabetes, and age <40 years. MSL-COVID-19 had good performance to predict COVID-19 mortality (c-statistic = 0.722, 95%CI 0.690-0.753) and severity (c-statistic = 0.777, 95%CI 0.753-0.801). The Nutri-CoV score includes the MSL-COVID-19 plus respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. This tool had better performance in both training (c-statistic = 0.797, 95%CI 0.765-0.826) and validation cohorts (c-statistic = 0.772, 95%CI 0.0.745-0.800) compared to other severity scores. Conclusions MSL-COVID-19 predicts inpatient COVID-19 lethality. The Nutri-CoV score is an adaptation of MSL-COVID-19 to be used in a triage environment. Both scores have been deployed as web-based tools for clinical use in a triage setting. Copyright:

AB  - All software written even today has bugs or defects. It is critical to fix bugs as quickly and efficiently as possible. Triaging bugs can be time-consuming, especially on larger teams or with larger projects. The process of assigning bugs to the proper developer is a task that can easily be automated and is a good exercise for using Machine Learning concepts. We will be studying sample data from the Google Chromium project using Machine Learning to analyze bugs by title and description to determine the best owner of a defect. We will use Natural Language Processing to analyze the bug title and description, looking for patterns to determine the correct developers to assign to bugs.

AB  - Are you bleeding? Validation of a machine-learning algorithm for determination of blood volume status: application to remote triage. to limited remote triage monitoring capabilities, combat medics cannot currently distinguish bleeding soldiers from those engaged in combat unless they have physical access to them. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that low-level physiological signals can be used to develop a machine-learning algorithm for tracking changes in central blood volume that will subsequently distinguish central hypovolemia from physical activity. Twenty-four subjects underwent central hypovolemia via lower body negative pressure (LBNP), and a supine-cycle exercise protocol. Exercise workloads were determined by matching heart rate responses from each LBNP level. Heart rate and stroke volume (SV) were measured via Finom-eter. ECG, heat flux, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and two-axis acceleration were obtained from an armband (SenseWear Pro2) and used to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict changes in SV as an index of central blood volume under both conditions. The algorithm SV was retrospectively compared against Finometer SV. A model was developed to determine whether unknown data points could be correctly classified into these two conditions using leave-one-out cross-validation. Algorithm vs. Finometer SV values were strongly correlated for LBNP in individual subjects (mean r 0.92; range 0.75-0.98), but only moderately correlated for exercise (mean r 0.50; range 0.23-0.87). From the first level of LBNP/exercise, the machine-learning algorithm was able to distinguish between LBNP and exercise with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all 90%). In conclusion, a machine-learning algorithm developed from low-level physiological signals could reliably distinguish central hypovolemia from exercise, indicating that this device could provide battlefield remote triage capabilities. triage algorithm; lower body negative pressure; exercise; central hypovolemia RECENT DATA INDICATE THAT 80% of potentially survivable battlefield injuries were due to hemorrhage from major trauma (15), consistent with reports of previous studies in this population (14, 17, 20). These findings highlight the requirement to improve clinical training and monitoring technologies in the prehospital setting to ensure early and accurate detection and treatment of life-threatening hemorrhage. Extensive investigations have been conducted to determine the early physiological responses to hemorrhage to develop advanced monitoring technologies for prehospital battlefield use by the first responder combat medic (6, 8). One area of particular focus has been on the development of monitoring techniques for "remote triage" applications (10, 22, 24), where the medic does not have physical and/or visual access to the injured patient. Since monitoring capabilities have not yet been developed for accurate clinical assessment of injuries in these remote battlefield settings, combat medics cannot currently distinguish a wounded and bleeding soldier from a soldier who is engaged in combat. Furthermore, current medical monitors do not provide adequate information for accurate determination of injury severity, even if the medic does have physical access to the patient (8). Our laboratory has previously shown that many vital signs, both standard [e.g., heart rate (HR), respiration rate] and derived (e.g., HR variability), lack the specificity required to distinguish a bleeding soldier from one who is physically active, as both conditions elicit similar physiological responses (e.g., increases in HR and decreases in HR variability) (22, 24). A measure of blood volume status, however, will be able to distinguish between these two conditions, as central blood volume increases with exercise and decreases during hemorrhage (22). Our laboratory recently reviewed the current status of "re-mote triage" applications for monitoring hemorrhaging patients in the military setting (24). In this review, preliminary data were presented on a novel technology that incorporates a machine-learning algorithm for the assessment of central blood volume via pulse pressure [a noninvasive surrogate of stroke volume (SV)]. These data demonstrated the ability of the algorithm to track a physiological feature associated with alterations in central blood volume (i.e., pulse pressure) induced by progressive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a simulation of hemorrhage in healthy human subjects (24). In the present "proof of concept" laboratory-based study, rather than assessing a surrogate of SV, we tested the hypothesis that a machine-learning algorithm could continuously track changes in actual SV (derived from the arterial pressure waveform), and subsequently distinguish central hypovolemia from exercise. METHODS Subjects Sample size calculation. A correlation coefficient of 0.75 between actual and predicted SV values is considered practically relevant for this study; based on r 0.75, a power of 0.8, and an of 0.05, a

AB  - Background: Patients with emergency conditions will get the first health service in the Emergency Room (IGD). The emergency room nurse has an important role in assessing and determining the severity of the patient. The nurse determines the priority of action and the need for treatment in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) using triage. One of the triage that can be done is triage scoring to facilitate nurses in determining high-risk and low-risk patients. Purpose: To find out the triage scoring used during the pandemic. Methods: Literature search is conducted using the PICO framework. This systematic review is limited to articles published from 2019-2021 with articles in English. The database used is Google Scholar. PubMed, Science Direct, and ProQuest which using the keywords score, triage, pandemic and emergency care. Results: Based on the three articles reviewed, an overview of the use of triage scores during a pandemic is obtained using the SODA score, modified PRIEST and double triage and telemedicine protocols. Giving the triage score can make it easier for health workers to identify high-risk patients and prevent unexpected events. Conclusion: Triage scoring can be applied at Covid-19 referral hospitals which helps nurses determine priorities and prevents special mortality in Indonesia, which is experiencing the second wave

AB  - The Mobile Emergency Triage system is an m-health decision support system that assists hospital Emergency Department physicians in triaging various acute pain presentations at the point of care. The system is designed following the extended client-server architecture, suited for weak-connectivity conditions. The server interacts with the hospital information system to exchange necessary information, and the client, running on a handheld computer, allows data entry and provides triage support. The support function, consulting decision rules stored in the knowledge base, runs solely on the client side, thus it can be invoked anytime and anywhere. The system recently underwent a successful clinical trial.

AB  - Every day, many people come to emergency departments; the orientation and placement of these patients in a waiting list according to the seriousness of their health conditions is an important task that requires a lot of skilled human resources and time. In addition, some people abuse the system by seeking care for minor problems, which significantly increases the emergency department overcrowding. To facilitate and accelerate the process of triage and referral in emergency departments, we propose to create a pervasive environment with a set of sensors. The information system (IS) of this space must exactly determine the patient's state of health and whether he or she must be presented urgently to a specialist, or may be queued according to a given order of priorities; in some cases, he or she must be referred to specialised emergency (maternity, psychiatry, cardiology, etc.). In this document, we present the architecture, implementation and simulation of our system for triage and referral in emergency departments.

AB  - The Android platform is highly targeted by malware developers, which aim to infect the maximum number of mobile devices by uploading their malicious applications to different app markets. In order to keep a healthy Android ecosystem, app-markets check the maliciousness of newly submitted apps. These markets need to (a) correctly detect malicious app, and (b) speed up the detection process of the most likely dangerous applications among an overwhelming flow of submitted apps, to quickly mitigate their potential damages. To address these challenges, we propose TriDroid, a market-scale triage and classification system for Android apps. TriDroid prioritizes apps analysis according to their risk likelihood. To this end, we categorize the submitted apps as: botnet, general malware, and benign. TriDroid starts by performing a (1) Triage process, which applies a fast coarse-grained and less-accurate analysis on a continuous stream of the submitted apps to identify their corresponding queue in a three-class priority queuing system. Then, (2) the Classification process extracts fine-grained static features from the apps in the priority queue, and applies three-class machine learning classifiers to confirm with high accuracy the classification decisions of the triage process. In addition to the priority queuing model, we also propose a multi-server queuing model where the classification of each app category is run on a different server. Experiments on a dataset with more than 24K malicious and 3K benign applications show that the priority model offers a trade-off between waiting time and processing overhead, as it requires only one server compared to the multi-server model. Also it successfully prioritizes malicious apps analysis, which allows a short waiting time for dangerous applications compared to the FIFO policy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute triage is needed to prioritize care and achieve optimal resource allocation in busy emergency departments. The main objective is to compare the FRench Emergency Nurse Classication in Hospital scale (FRENCH) to the American scale Emergency Severity Index (ESI). Secondary objectives are to compare for each scale the over and under-triage, the triage matching to the gold standard and the inter-individual sorting reproducibility between the nurses. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducting among the nursing staffs and nursing students, selected from Caen University College Hospital and Lisieux Hospital Center emergency departments between two months. Each group individually rank 60 referent clinical cases composed by scales designers. An assessment of scale practicality is collected after for each tool. The collected parameters are analyzed by a Cohen kappa concordance test (κ). RESULTS: With 8101 triage results of gold standard scenarios sorting in two scales by the same nurses, the FRENCH scale seems to give better triage results than the US ESI scale (nurse: FRENCH 60% and ESI 53%, p=0.003 ; nursing students: FRENCH 49% and ESI 42%, p<0.001). In the two groups ESI has also a big tendency to under-sort (p=0.01), particularly for the most severe patients (p<0.01). The interobserver sorting concordance for any experience gives good results for the FRENCH and the ESI without any difference (nurses : FRENCH K PQ =0.72 ESI K PQ =0.78; p=0.32 ; students K PQ =0.44 K PQ =0.55; p=0.22). CONCLUSION: The ESI and FRENCH scales comparison on 8101 sorting results shows direct validity in favor of FRENCH one and similar interobserver agreement for both scales.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a probabilistic algorithm with user feedback loop, which can be used for decision making during the patient triage process. Given an R{x, y} the method relies on the user defining a set of x values (i.e. symptoms) and the algorithm returns a collection of y values as a hidden layer (possible diseases), taking into consideration a possible false negative user reporting, by looking into candidate values of y and identifying x values (symptoms) which have not been initially provided by the user. The user can specify parameters such as the minimum probability ratio of the final output, the minimum probability ratio of the y values for which the non-user given x values will be re-evaluated, and the maximum number of user feedback loops. In order to validate the method, we use a comprehensive 2012 Medicare Claims dataset with 15 million cases.

This research is based on a systematic review of the literature in scientific databases from 2010 to early 2021, following a prism methodology. In addition, a Google Play Store search of the triage apps found in the literature was performed for further evaluation. A total of 26 relevant papers were obtained for this study, of which 13 apps were identified. After searching for each of these apps in the Google Play Store platform, only 2 of them were obtained, and these were subsequently evaluated together with another app obtained from the link provided in the corresponding paper. In the analysis carried out, it was detected that from 2019 onwards there has been an increase in research interest in this area, since the papers obtained from this year onwards represent 38.5% of the relevant papers. This increase may be caused by the need for early selection of the most serious patients in such difficult times for the health service. According to the review carried out, an increase in mobile app research focused on Emergency Triage and a decrease in app studies for triage catastrophe have been identified. In this study it was also observed that despite the existence of many researches in this sense, only 3 apps contained in them are accessible. "TRIAGIST" does not allow the entry of an unidentified user, "Major Trauma Triage Tool" presents negative comments from users who have used it and "ESITriage" lacks updates to improve its performance.

AB  - Clinical triage is a key process in emergency departments because it allows clinicians to prioritize patient treatments based on their health condition. Handling this process adequately will allow those departments to operate efficiently. Most of its concerns are related to its effectiveness due to the short timeframes that clinical staff have during the process and the lack of valuable, timely and pertinent information available. In several contexts, this problem has been addressed by using clinical decision support systems. However, there is not enough information about architectural approaches dealing with key quality attributes and restrictions involved in those systems. This paper aims to analyze and discuss a feasible architectural approach to implement a clinical decision support system for clinical triage by adapting proposals from other scenarios. As main contribution, this proposal describes the architecture design process applied through a well-known standard and emphasizes tactics for performance, availability and security. For this purpose, an attribute-driven design method was followed, concluding that it is a convenient approach because it allows to iterate easily the entire system by prioritizing key elements. The achieved results are useful for architects, implementers, practitioners and researchers to extend the architecture and apply it.

AB  - Resumen de diseño en Ingeniería Triage is a system that classifies and selects patients in emergency services that allows a quick and organized assessment of them. Over the years, it has been established that for triage category I, immediate assistance should be provided. Triage category II, you must be given an assist of less than 30 minutes. Triage category III, assistance must be provided within the next two hours. In triage categories IV and V, the range is between twelve (12) and seventy-two hours (72), so it is suggested to support a priority or outpatient consultation. Next, of the five categories, the third one is prone to have a worsening in the clinical profile of the already classified patient, although to be there it is assumed that their health status threatens their life and that is why they must obtain urgent care and not on an outpatient basis. The service is also not considered vital to be categorized in any of the previous categories. Due to the highly variable scenario presented in triage III, the development of a classification model is proposed through the CRISP-DM methodology to create triage subcategories that allow different priorities to be given to classified patients. This case study was carried out at the San Ignacio University Hospital. The process to design the proposed model implied two phases. In the first phase various classification methods were tested, such as KNN distance algorithms, naive as Naive Bayes, parametric such as multinomial logistic regression, individual trees and random forest. In the second phase the mentioned method were compared and we identify that the best option was the assembly algorithms since it is capable of identifying correctly 80.14%, 79.45%, 81.29% and patients classified as discharged, referred and dead, respectively. Some restrictions and limitations when implementing this project were: the amount of data available to carry out the model, the quantity of records of the dead state is very low in comparison with the quantity of total records and, there was no information such as the patient's symptoms and no access to the medical history. This information could be very useful to improve the classification process.

AB  - In this paper we conduct an extensive review of the literature toward an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for application in home healthcare. Based on the research findings, a system is proposed towards such a UAV for the purpose of patient care in an indoor environment, specifically in triage care for people living with chronic conditions. Our system seeks to provide an innovative solution for healthcare at home and to facilitate independent living as well as reduce over triaging through personalized robotics. The development of advanced navigation systems for UAVs has aroused extensive interest recently because of its enormous potential. In comparison to outdoor flight, GPS-denied navigation poses several distinct challenges in stability and control for quadcopter operability, including object detection and avoidance, real-time wireless client-server communications, stability and safety concerns. Medical Decision Support Systems (DSSs), which have been developed largely in the triage component of health assessment, care and decision making, also pose separate research challenges in terms of accuracy, consistency, response (processing) time and degree of automatic operation. As a single system, a drone-based DSS for chronic illness triage assessment poses unique challenges. For this application, the DSS requires voice-based responses, occurring in real-time and classified according to a dynamic and adaptive decision support engine that operates automatically; that is, with no human input and using non-invasive patient analysis. Existing healthcare systems of this nature have not yet been produced. Furthermore, patient recognition through real-time image fused with voice data in a noisy, GPS-denied environment has yet to be achieved. While path planning, navigation, control and stability concerns have been extensively addressed, accuracy for these systems can be improved and the technology as well as applied algorithms must be adapted to application-based requirements, in terms of weight, processing and dedicated communication requirements.

Abstract: With population growth and aging, the emergence of new diseases and immunodeficiency, the demand for emergency departments (EDs) increases, making overcrowding in these departments a global problem. Due to the disease severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, it is necessary to provide an accurate and automated triage system to classify and isolate the suspected cases. Different triage methods for COVID-19 patients have been proposed as disease symptoms vary by country. Still, several problems with triage systems remain unresolved, most notably overcrowding in EDs, lengthy waiting times and difficulty adjusting static triage systems when the nature and symptoms of a disease changes. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of general ED triage systems as well as COVID-19 triage systems. We identified important parameters that we recommend considering when designing an e-Triage (electronic triage) system for EDs, namely waiting time, simplicity, reliability, validity, scalability, and adaptability. Moreover, the study proposes a scoring-based e-Triage system for COVID-19 along with several recommended solutions to enhance the overall outcome of e-Triage systems during the outbreak. The recommended solutions aim to reduce overcrowding and overheads in EDs by remotely assessing patients' conditions and identifying their severity levels.

AB  - Background: Technology-based systems can facilitate remote decision-making to triage patients to the appropriate level of care. Despite technologic advances, the effects of implementation of these systems on patient and utilization outcomes are unclear. We evaluated the effects of remote triage systems on healthcare utilization, case resolution, and patient safety outcomes. Methods: English-language searches of MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and CINAHL were performed from inception until July 2018. Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies of remote triage services that reported healthcare utilization, case resolution, and patient safety outcomes were included. Two reviewers assessed study and intervention characteristics independently for study quality, strength of evidence, and risk of bias. Results: The literature search identified 5026 articles, of which eight met eligibility criteria. Five randomized, two controlled before-and-after, and one interrupted time series study assessed 3 categories of remote triage services: mode of delivery, triage professional type, and system organizational level. No study evaluated any other delivery mode other than telephone and in-person. Meta-analyses were unable to be performed because of study design and outcome heterogeneity; therefore, we narratively synthesized data. Overall, most studies did not demonstrate a decrease in primary care (PC) or emergency department (ED) utilization, with some studies showing a significant increase. Evidence suggested local, practice-based triage systems have greater case resolution and refer fewer patients to PC or ED services than regional/national systems. No study identified statistically significant differences in safety outcomes. Conclusion: Our review found limited evidence that remote triage reduces the burden of PC or ED utilization. However, remote triage by telephone can produce a high rate of call resolution and appears to be safe. Further study of other remote triage modalities is needed to realize the promise of remote triage services in optimizing healthcare outcomes. Protocol Registration: This study was registered and followed a published protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42019112262).

AB  - Selective nonoperative management of blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma is safe, has eliminated the complications associated with nontherapeutic laparotomies, and is cost-effective. Appropriately selected investigations, such as focused abdominal sonography for trauma, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, diagnostic laparoscopy, or thoracoscopy and angiography, play a critical role in the triage of patients. Future technological advances, such as improvement of the ultrasonic hardware and software that provide automated interpretation and the availability of portable CT scan machines in the emergency room, may improve the speed and accuracy of the initial evaluation. Improvement of the optical system of minilaparoscopes may allow reliable bedside laparoscopy for suspected diaphragmatic injuries.

AB  - During spring 2020, SARS-CoV-2 pandemic induced shortage of medical equipment, hospital capacity and staff. To tackle this issue, medical students have been strongly involved in early patient triage through medical phone call regulation. Here, we present an intelligent web-based decision support system for COVID-19 phone call regulation, developed by and for, medical students to help them during this difficult but crucial task. The system is divided into 5 tabs. The first tab displays administrative information, clinical data related to life-threatening emergency, and personalized recommendations for patient management. The second tab displays a PDF report summarizing the clinical situation; the third tab displays the guidelines used for establishing the recommendations, and the fourth tab displays the overall algorithm in the form of a decision tree. The fifth tab provided a short user guide. The system was assessed by 21 medical staff. More than 90% of them appreciated the navigation and the interface, and found the content relevant. 90,5% of them would like to use it during the medical regulation. In the future, we plan to use this system during simulation-based medical learning for the initial medical training of medical students.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of organizational factors on individual decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and time pressure. A method to assess the impact of individual and organizational factors on individual decisions is proposed and experimented in the context of triage decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach: The adopted methodology is based on the bias-variance decomposition formula. The method, usually applied to assess the predictive accuracy of heuristics, has been adjusted to discriminate between the impact of organizational and individual factors affecting heuristic processes. To test the methodology, 25 clinical scenarios have been designed and submitted, through simulations, to the triage nurses of two Spanish hospitals. Findings: Nurses’ decisions are affected by organizational factors in certain task conditions, such as situations characterized by complete and coherent information. When relevant information is lacking and available information is not coherent, decision-makers base their assessments on their personal experience and gut feeling. Research limitations/implications: Discriminating between the influence of organizational factors and individual ones is the starting point for a more in-depth understanding of how organization can guide the decision process. Using simulations of clinical scenarios in field research does not allow for capturing the influence of some contextual factors, such as the nurses’ stress levels, on individual decisions. This issue will be addressed in further research. Practical implications: Bias and variance are useful measurements for detecting process improvement actions. A bias prevalence requires a re-design of organizational settings, whereas training would be preferred when variance prevails. Originality/value: The main contribution of this work concerns the novel interpretation of bias and variance concepts to assess organizational factors’ influence on heuristic decision-making processes, taking into account the level of complexity of decision-related tasks.

AB  - Revascularization therapies have been established as the treatment mainstay for acute ischemic stroke. However, a substantial number of patients are either ineligible for revascularization therapy, or the treatment fails or is futile. At present, non-contrast computed tomography is the first-line neuroimaging modality for patients with acute stroke. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the response to early revascularization therapy and to identify patients for delayed treatment is desirable. MRI could provide information on stroke pathophysiologies, including the ischemic core, perfusion, collaterals, clot, and blood-brain barrier status. During the past 20 years, there have been significant advances in neuroimaging as well as in revascularization strategies for treating patients with acute ischemic stroke. In this review, we discuss the role of MRI and post-processing, including machine-learning techniques, and recent advances in MRI-based triage for revascularization therapies in acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - Background: Crowding in the emergency department (ED) is a safety concern, and pathways to bypass the ED have been introduced to reduce the time to definitive care. Conversely, a number of low-acuity patients in the ED could be assessed by the emergency medical services (EMS) as requiring a lower level of care. The limited access to primary care in Sweden leaves the EMS nurse to either assess the patient as requiring the ED or to stay at the scene. This study aimed to assess patient characteristics and evaluate the initial assessment by and utilisation of the ambulance triage system and the appropriateness of non-transport decisions. Methods: A prospective observational study including 6712 patients aged ≥16 years was conducted. The patient records with 72 h of follow-up for non-transported patients were reviewed. Outcomes of death, time-critical conditions, complications within 48 h and final hospital assessment were evaluated. The Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and Spearman's rank correlation were used for statistical analysis. Results: The median patient age was 66 years, and the most common medical history was a circulatory diagnosis. Males received a higher priority from dispatchers and were more frequently assessed at the scene as requiring hospital care. A total of 1312 patients (19.7%) were non-transported; a history of psychiatric disorders or no medical history was more commonly noted among these patients. Twelve (0.9%) of the 1312 patients not transported were later admitted with time-critical conditions. Full triage was applied in 77.4% of the cases, and older patients were triaged at the scene as an 'unspecific condition' more frequently than younger patients. Overall, the 30-day mortality was 4.1% (n = 274). Conclusions: Age, sex, medical history, and presentation all appear to influence the initial assessment. A number of patients transported to ED could be managed at a lower level of care. A small proportion of the non-transported patients were later diagnosed with a time-critical condition, warranting improved assessment tools at the scene and education of the personnel focusing on the elderly population. These results may be useful in addressing resource allocation issues aiming at increasing patient safety.

AB  - The recent medical applications of deep-learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated their clinical efficacy in improving speed and accuracy of image interpretation. If the DL algorithm achieves a performance equivalent to that achieved by physicians in chest radiography (CR) diagnoses with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, the automatic interpretation of the CR with DL algorithms can significantly reduce the burden on clinicians and radiologists in sudden surges of suspected COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR compared with formal radiology reports. This is a retrospective study of adult patients that were diagnosed as positive COVID-19 cases based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction among all the patients who were admitted to five emergency departments and one community treatment center in Korea from February 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020. The CR images were evaluated with a publicly available DL algorithm. For reference, CR images without chest computed tomography (CT) scans classified as positive for COVID-19 pneumonia were used given that the radiologist identified ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or other infiltration in retrospectively reviewed CR images. Patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest CT scans were also classified as COVID-19 pneumonia positive outcomes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR were 95.6%, and 88.7%, respectively. The area under the curve value of the DL algorithm for the detection of COVID-19 with pneumonia was 0.921. The DL algorithm demonstrated a satisfactory diagnostic performance comparable with that of formal radiology reports in the CR-based diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The DL algorithm may offer fast and reliable examinations that can facilitate patient screening and isolation decisions, which can reduce the medical staff workload during COVID-19 pandemic situations.

AB  - Triage is a globally adopted principle for prioritizing patients in emergency departments. The purpose of triage is to ensure that in emergency situations, whenever medical demand exceeds medical supply, limited resources should be directed to the case with the greatest clinical need. 1 Triage methodologically fulfills this purpose by ranking patients according to how acute their condition is and then giving priority to the most acute ones. Although triage may, at first sight, appear to be a fair way of prioritizing emergency department patients , and arguably justifiable on either utilitarian 2 or egalitarian grounds, 3 I claim that the principle is insensitive to the diversity of patients in contemporary emergency departments (EDs) and hence is not suitable as a standalone principle for prioritizing ED patients. The paper contains both a negative and positive thesis. The negative thesis asserts that the current use of triage in EDs is incorrect. Triage is relevant when it comes to prioritizing acute patients above sub-acute ones, but it does not provide guidance as how to prioritize among sub-acute patients, who are in fact the largest group of patients in most EDs. This, furthermore, appears problematic. Studies indicate that patients experience the need of a more holistic approach to provision of care than provided by triage, 4 that triage nurses have somewhat low concordance with triage manuals, 5 and nurses experience some antipathy and resistance toward implementing these manuals. 6 Health professionals working in EDs tend, moreover, to experience considerable levels of occupational stress, 7 and studies indicate that emergency nurses are especially likely to 1 Windle, J., & Mackway-Jones, K. (2003). Don't throw triage out with the bathwater. Abstract Triage is a widespread principle for prioritizing patients in emergency departments. The purpose of triage is to ensure that in emergency situations, whenever medical demand exceeds medical supply, limited resources should be directed to the case with the greatest clinical need. Triage fulfills this purpose by ranking patients according to how acute their condition is and then giving priority to the most acute ones. In this paper, I argue that this current practice of triage needs to be supplemented. Contemporary triage is based on a principle of preserving patients' core capabilities, which is relevant when it comes to prioritizing acute patients above sub-acute ones, but not for prioritizing among sub-acute patients, which is the largest group of emergency patients. Henceforth, I propose to supplement triage with what I term the real dialogue model, a framework that, when combined with enhanced professional autonomy for clinical decision-makers, enables fair prioritizing among sub-acute patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To test diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR imaging techniques within the extreme time constraints of stroke evaluation before therapy, and then, with MR imaging, stratify patients into those without ischemia, those with noncortical ischemia, and those with cortical ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T2-weighted turbo gradient- and spin-echo images and echo-planar diffusion- and perfusion-weighted images were obtained. Trace diffusion- weighted images and time-to-peak perfusion maps were automatically postprocessed and immediately available for interpretation. RESULTS: Forty- one patients with acute stroke symptoms underwent imaging within 6 hours of symptom onset; 35 were eligible for the therapy protocol. The mean time from entering the emergency department to beginning MR imaging was 45 minutes; the mean total MR imaging time was less than 15 minutes. Immediate image analysis directly affected individual clinical management. Four patients showed evidence of no infarct; seven, of lacunar infarct; and 24, of acute cortical infarct. Sixteen patients underwent angiography, thirteen had large-vessel occlusion, eleven were treated intraarterially, and in seven, recanalization was achieved. CONCLUSION: Echo-planar diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR imaging for acute stroke is feasible and applicable before therapy decisions. Ultrafast MR imaging permitted immediate triage of 35 patients with symptoms of hyperacute stroke and thus helped avoid the risks from angiography and thrombolytic agents in some or spurred the judicious use of more aggressive intervention in others.

AB  - This study was conducted to contribute to active disaster response by developing internet of things (IoT)-based vital sign monitoring e-triage tag system to improve the survival rate at disaster mass casualty incidents fields. The model used in this study for developing the e-triage tag system is the rapid prototyping model (RAD). The process comprised six steps: analysis, design, development, evaluation, implementation, and simulation. As a result of detailed assessment of the system design and development by an expert group, areas with the highest score in the triage sensor evaluation were rated "very good", with 5 points for continuous vital sign data delivery, portability, and robustness. In addition, ease of use, wearability, and electricity consumption were rated 4.8, 4.7, and 4.6 points, respectively. In the triage application evaluation, the speed and utility scored a perfect 5 points, and the reliability and expressiveness were rated 4.9 points and 4.8 points, respectively. This study will contribute significantly to increasing the survival rate via the development of a conceptual prehospital triage for field applications and e-triage tag system implementation.

AB  - Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care units and hospital preparedness for an influenza pandemic. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics. Results: Key recommendations include: Hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas. Hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas. Establish a management system with control groups at facility, local, regional and/or national levels to exercise authority over resources. Establish a system of communication, coordination and collaboration between the ICU and key interface departments. A plan to access, coordinate and increase labor resources is required with a central inventory of all clinical and non-clinical staff. Delegate duties not within the usual scope of workers' practice. Ensure that adequate essential medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and supplies are available. Protect patients and staff with infection control practices and supporting occupational health policies. Maintain staff confidence with reassurance plans for legal protection and assistance. Have objective, ethical, transparent triage criteria that are applied equitably and publically disclosed. ICU triage of patients should be based on the likelihood for patients to benefit most or a 'first come, first served' basis. Develop protocols for safe performance of high-risk procedures. Train and educate staff. Conclusions: Mortality, although inevitable during a severe influenza outbreak or disaster, can be reduced by adequate preparation. © 2010 Copyright jointly hold by Springer and ESICM.

AB  - The acute scrotum is a clinical condition in boys and adolescent males that is normally first assessed in the Emergency Department of a hospital. We used data from the patients' charts and applied knowledge discovery technique based on rough set theory to develop a clinical decision algorithm for triaging patients with this condition. As demonstrated by a limited retrospective evaluation, the algorithm supports early triage decisions on the basis of readily available information, resulting in good triage accuracy. In order to make the algorithm usable in clinical practice, to integrate it with the workflow, and to make it available at the point of care, we implemented it as an application in the mobile clinical decision support environment called MET (Mobile Emergency Triage). MET uses ontologies to represent domains of various acute presentations and triage support functionalities, and renders specific applications on demand from these ontologies.

AB  - Background Computerized algorithms known as symptom checkers aim to help patients decide what to do should they have a new medical concern. However, despite widespread implementation, most studies on symptom checkers have involved simulated patients. Only limited evidence currently exists about symptom checker safety or accuracy when used by real patients. We developed a new prototype symptom checker and assessed its safety and accuracy in a prospective cohort of patients presenting to primary care and emergency departments with new medical concerns. Method A prospective cohort study was done to assess the prototype's performance. The cohort consisted of adult patients (≥16 years old) who presented to hospital emergency departments and family physician clinics. Primary outcomes were safety and accuracy of triage recommendations to seek hospital care, seek primary care, or manage symptoms at home. Results Data from 281 hospital patients and 300 clinic patients were collected and analyzed. Sensitivity to emergencies was 100% (10/10 encounters). Sensitivity to urgencies was 90% (73/ 81) and 97% (34/35) for hospital and primary care patients, respectively. The prototype was significantly more accurate than patients at triage (73% versus 58%, p<0.01). Compliance with triage recommendations in this cohort using this iteration of the symptom checker would have reduced hospital visits by 55% but cause potential harm in 2-3% from delay in care. Interpretation The prototype symptom checker was superior to patients in deciding the most appropriate treatment setting for medical issues. This symptom checker could reduce a significant number of unnecessary hospital visits, with accuracy and safety outcomes comparable to existing data on telephone triage.

AB  - Objective: To identify the accuracy of a camera-enabled mobile phone in assessing patients with nasal bone injuries and to determine if treatment in the form of manipulation of the nasal bones and therefore outpatient attendance was necessary. Methods: Prospective study of patients with nasal injuries attending the weekly ear-nose-throat emergency clinic. The patient is assessed and examined, and a preset questionnaire is filled out. An anteroposterior photograph and an overhead photograph of the nose are taken. The pictures are then e-mailed to a senior member of the team who reviews the pictures and determines based on the images whether intervention in the form of manipulation of nasal bones was required. The results were then compared with the actual assessment and management in the clinic. Results: Of the 50 patients assessed, 94% showed a direct correlation between the perceived need for treatment based on the clinical images and the actual management in the outpatient clinic. The results also showed the test to be 88% specific and 100% sensitive. Conclusions: We conclude that the use of a mobile phone camera to assess nasal bone injuries could be a useful triage tool in correctly identifying patients who may require intervention in the form of nasal bone manipulation. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Accurate assessment of a childs health is critical for appropriate allocation of medical resources and timely delivery of healthcare in Emergency Departments. The accurate measurement of vital signs is a key step in the determination of the severity of illness and respiratory rate is currently the most difficult vital sign to measure accurately. Several previous studies have attempted to extract respiratory rate from photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings. However, the majority have been conducted in controlled settings using PPG recordings from healthy subjects. In many studies, manual selection of clean sections of PPG recordings was undertaken before assessing the accuracy of the signal processing algorithms developed. Such selection procedures are not appropriate in clinical settings. A major limitation of AR modelling, previously applied to respiratory rate estimation, is an appropriate selection of model order. This study developed a novel algorithm that automatically estimates respiratory rate from a median spectrum constructed applying multiple AR models to processed PPG segments acquired with pulse oximetry using a finger probe. Good-quality sections were identified using a dynamic template-matching technique to assess PPG signal quality. The algorithm was validated on 205 children presenting to the Emergency Department at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK, with reference respiratory rates up to 50 breaths per minute estimated by paediatric nurses. At the time of writing, the authors are not aware of any other study that has validated respiratory rate estimation using data collected from over 200 children in hospitals during routine triage.

AB  - Objective: The present study aims to prospectively validate the Sydney Triage to Admission Risk Tool (START) to predict ED disposition. Methods: This was a prospective validation study at two metropolitan EDs in Sydney, Australia. Consecutive triage encounters were observed by a trained researcher and START scores calculated. The primary outcome was patient disposition (dis-charge or inpatient admission) from the ED. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate area under curve of receiver operator characteristic (AUC ROC) for START scores as well as START score in combination with other variables such as frailty, general practitioner referral, overcrowding and major medical comorbidities. Results: There were 894 patients analysed during the study period. The START score when applied to the data had AUC ROC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83). The inclusion of other clinical variables identified at triage did not improve the overall performance of the model with an AUC ROC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78-0.84) in the present study. Conclusion: The overall performance of the START tool with respect to model discrimination and accuracy has been prospectively validated. Further clinical trials are required to test the clinical effectiveness of the tool in improving patient flow and overall ED performance.

AB  - The new and ground-breaking real-time remote monitoring in triage and priority-based sensor technology used in telemedicine have significantly bounded and dispersed communication components. To examine these technologies and provide researchers with a clear vision of this area, we must first be aware of the utilised approaches and existing limitations in this line of research. To this end, an extensive search was conducted to find articles dealing with (a) telemedicine, (b) triage, (c) priority and (d) sensor; (e) comprehensively review related applications and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were checked for articles on triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the type of telemedicine technology explored. A total of 150 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category includes reviews and surveys of triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The second category includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. Tier 1 represents the users. Sensors acquire the vital signs of the users and send them to Tier 2, which is the personal gateway that uses local area network protocols or wireless body area network. Medical data are sent from Tier 2 to Tier 3, which is the healthcare provider in medical institutes. Then, the motivation for using triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine, the issues related to the obstruction of its application and the development and utilisation of telemedicine are examined on the basis of the findings presented in the literature.

AB  - Health data bear great promises for a healthier and happier life, but they also  make us vulnerable. Making use of millions or billions of data points, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are now creating new benefits. For sure, harvesting Big Data can have great potentials for the health system, too. It can support accurate diagnoses, better treatments and greater cost effectiveness. However, it can also have undesirable implications, often in the sense of undesired side effects, which may in fact be terrible. Examples for this, as discussed in this article, are discrimination, the mechanisation of death, and genetic, social, behavioural or technological selection, which may imply eugenic effects or social Darwinism. As many unintended effects become visible only after years, we still lack sufficient criteria, long-term experience and advanced methods to reliably exclude that things may go terribly wrong. Handing over decision-making, responsibility or control to machines, could be dangerous and irresponsible. It would also be in serious conflict with human rights and our constitution.

AB  - Title. Nurses' experiences with telephone triage and advice: a meta-ethnography. Aims. This study is a meta-ethnography of nurses' experiences with telephone triage and advice and factors that facilitate or impede their decision-making process. Background. Telephone triage and advice services are a rapidly expanding development in health care. Unlike traditional forms of nursing practice, telenurses offer triage recommendations and advice to the general public without visual cues. Data sources. Published qualitative research on telephone triage and advice were sought from interdisciplinary research databases (1980-2008) and bibliographical reviews of retrieved studies. Review methods. Our systematic search identified 16 relevant studies. Two researchers independently reviewed, critically appraised, and extracted key themes and concepts from each study. We followed techniques of meta-ethnography to synthesize the findings, using both reciprocal and refutational translation to compare similar or contradictory findings, and a line-of-arguments synthesis. Results. We identified five major themes that highlight common issues and concerns experienced by telenurses: gaining and maintaining skills, autonomy, new work environment, holistic assessment, and stress and pressure. A line-of-arguments synthesis produced a three-stage model that describes the decision-making process used by telenurses and highlights how assessments largely depend on the ability to 'build a picture' of the patient and the presenting health issue. Conclusion. Telenurses experience a range of common concerns and issues which either impede or facilitate the decision-making process. Although 'building a pic-ture' of the patient is key to making assessments over the telephone, final triage decisions are influenced by balancing the conflicting demands of being both carer and gatekeeper to limited healthcare services.

AB  - Introduction: Telephone triage systems are frequently used due to their success in decreasing emergency department utilization, reduction of health care costs, and high levels of satisfaction among patients and providers. Despite phone triage's prevalence, few residency programs have designated curricula for residents to learn this vital skill. Methods: We designed a phone triage curriculum initially piloted with senior residents at one of our continuity clinics. The curriculum consisted of a didactic session, a just-in-time simulation training session, and an experiential component of being on call during the ambulatory rotation. Retrospective pre-post self-assessments evaluated resident perceptions of their skills in taking histories and triaging care over the phone in addition to obtaining qualitative feedback from faculty and residents immediately after the curriculum and 1-2 years postgraduation. Results: Of 11 eligible residents, 10 (91%) chose to participate in the pilot curriculum. Residents reported that their skills in history taking over the phone improved from 20% to 90% and their ability to triage patients over the phone improved from 0% to 80%. This led to a quality improvement initiative to increase patient calls and has continued for 5 years, with continued positive feedback from residents and attendings. Discussion: Phone triage skills are a necessity for pediatric providers, but few residency programs have training curricula in place. Through an experience-based phone triage program, residents significantly improved their self-reported skills at history taking and triaging. Similar curricula could easily be adopted at other institutions.

AB  - Purpose: This study presented the experience of improving the nucleic acid sample collection and transportation service in response to the epidemic. The main purpose is that through intelligent path planning, combined with the time scheduling of sample points, the process of obtaining results to determine the state of COVID-19 patients could be speeding up. Design/methodology/approach: The research optimized the process, including finding an optimal path to traverse all sample points in the hospital area via intelligent path planning method and standardizing the operation through the time sequence scheduling of each round of support staff to collect and send samples in the hospital area, so as to ensure the shortest time in each round. And the study examines these real-time experiments through retrospective examination. Findings: The real-time experiments' data showed that the proposed path planning and scheduling model could provide a reliable reference for improving the efficiency of hospital logistics. Testing is a very important part of diagnosis and prompt results are essential. It shows the possibility of applying the shortest-path algorithms to optimize sample collection processes in the hospital and presents the case study that gives the expected outcomes of such a process. Originality/value: The value of the study lies in the abstraction of a very practical and urgent problem into a TSP. Combining the ant colony algorithm with the genetic algorithm (ACAGA), the performance of path planning is improved. Under the intervention and guidance, the efficiency of hospital regional logistics planning was greatly improved, which may be of greater benefit to critical patients who must go through fever clinic during the epidemic. By detailing how to more rapidly obtain results through engineering method, the paper contributes ideas and plans for practitioners to use. The experience and lessons learned from Tongji Hospital are expected to provide guidance for supporting service measures in national public health infrastructure management and valuable reference for the development of hospitals in other countries or regions.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse the most important documents establishing the criteria for the treatment and exclusion of COVID-19 patients, especially in regard to the giving of respiratory support, in Italy and Spain. These documents reflect a tension that stems from limited healthcare resources which are insufficient to save lives that, under normal conditions, could have been saved, or at least could have received the best possible treatment. First, we analyse the healthcare systems of these two countries before the spread of the virus, both of which have seen decreases in the number of intensive care beds and have been marked by financial cuts during the last ten years. It is a fact that a greater number of people, especially those over 70 years of age, have been left without respiratory support treatment, and therefore, there have been a greater number of deaths.

AB  - Background: Priority dispatch accuracy is a key issue in optimizing the match between patients' medical needs and pre-hospital resources. This study measures the accuracy of a Criteria Based Dispatch (CBD) system, by evaluating discrepancies between dispatch priorities and ambulance crews' severity evaluations. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted from January 2011 to December 2011. We ruled that a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) score > 3 (injuries/diseases which can possibly lead to deterioration of vital signs) to 7 (lethal injuries/ diseases) should require a priority dispatch with lights and siren (L&S), while NACA scores < 4 should require a priority dispatch without L&S. Over triage was defined as the proportion of L&S dispatches with a NACA score < 4, and under triage as the proportion of dispatches without L&S with a NACA score > 3. Results: There were 29,008 primary missions in 2011, 1122 were excluded. Of the 15,749 L&S missions, 12,333 patients had a NACA score < 4, leading to an over triage rate of 78 %; 561 missions out of 12,137 missions without L&S had a NACA score > 3, leading to an under triage rate of 4.6 %. Sensitivity was 86 % (95 % confidence interval: 85.6-86.4 %), specificity 48 % (47.4-48.6 %), positive predictive value 21.7 % (21.2-22.2 %), and negative predictive value 95.4 % (95.2-95.6 %). Conclusion: The rates of over triage and under triage in our CBD are 78 and 4.6 % respectively. The lack of consistent or universal metrics is perhaps the most important limitation in dispatch accuracy research. This is mainly due to the large heterogeneity of dispatch systems and prehospital emergency system.

Triage nurses should have the proper education and proficiency in emergency triage, decision making, and emergency nursing care. Training on triage is an integral part of emergency nursing education. Poor performance and lack of education are well documented in the literature. Aim: This study aimed at evaluating the effect of triage education on emergency nurses' performance in diverse emergency departments. Methods: Quasi-experimental (pre, post-test design) used to achieve the aim of this study. A purposive sample of one hundred fifty emergency nurses worked at pediatric, Obstetric, and adult emergency departments affiliated to three major governmental hospitals in Beni-Suef Governorate. The nurses' knowledge, practice, and attitude have been assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, triage competencies observational checklist, and nurses' attitude measuring scale. Results: The study revealed poor nurses' triage knowledge, practice, and negative attitude for the studied nurses before triage education, compared to a significant improvement after triage educational program, with a statistically significant difference among the three-implementation phases (pre, post, and one month follow up). Conclusion: The nurses who are subjected to triage education improved in their knowledge, practice, and attitude at the post-intervention evaluation compared to their pre-intervention level, which was sustained after one-month follow-up. These findings support the study hypotheses. Based on these findings, the study recommended the publication and dissemination of the triage educational program. Besides, fostering and sustaining the improvements in practices regarding triage in ED through the orientation of new nurses, on-the-job training, and continuous education.

Abstract: To explore the characteristics of the patient under investigation (PUI), and the routes and the patient journey time in our outpatient service, we examined the demographic data, presenting symptoms, risks of contact with COVID-19 cases, and the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in PUI cases from March to May 2020. The contact time, transfer time and total journey time of patient journey routes in our hospital were also explored. The results were shown in numbers, percentages and medians (interquartile range, IQR). A total of 334 PUI cases were identified from our triage system. The median (IQR) age was 35 (27, 47) years. Cough was the most common presenting symptom (56.2%), while fever (≥37.5 • C) was found in only 19.8% of the cases. The median (IQR) time of onset of the presenting symptoms was 3 (1, 5) days. The most common risk of contact with COVID-19 cases found during the triage was living in or returning from an outbreak area. Fifteen (4.5%) of the PUI cases had positive real-time PCR tests. The contact time and transfer time were longest in the PUI ward and from the Emergency Department (ED) to the PUI ward, respectively. Plans and actions to shorten the transfer time between the ED and the PUI ward and the total journey time should be developed.

AB  - Background: Many people with musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders wait several months or years for Consultant Doctor appointments, despite often not requiring medical or surgical interventions. To allow earlier patient access to orthopaedic and rheumatology services in Ireland, Advanced Practice Physiotherapists (APPs) were introduced at 16 major acute hospitals. This study performed the first national evaluation of APP triage services. Method: Throughout 2014, APPs (n = 22) entered clinical data on a national database. Analysis of these data using descriptive statistics determined patient wait times, Consultant Doctor involvement in clinical decisions, and patient clinical outcomes. Chi square tests were used to compare patient clinical outcomes across orthopaedic and rheumatology clinics. A pilot study at one site identified re-referral rates to orthopaedic/rheumatology services of patients managed by the APPs. Results: In one year, 13,981 new patients accessed specialist orthopaedic and rheumatology consultations via the APP. Median wait time for an appointment was 5.6 months. Patients most commonly presented with knee (23%), lower back (22%) and shoulder (15%) disorders. APPs made autonomous clinical decisions regarding patient management at 77% of appointments, and managed patient care pathways without onward referral to Consultant Doctors in more than 80% of cases. Other onward clinical pathways recommended by APPs were: physiotherapy referrals (42%); clinical investigations (29%); injections administered (4%); and surgical listing (2%). Of those managed by the APP, the pilot study identified that only 6.5% of patients were re-referred within one year. Conclusion: This national evaluation of APP services demonstrated that the majority of patients assessed by an APP did not require onward referral for a Consultant Doctor appointment. Therefore, patients gained earlier access to orthopaedic and rheumatology consultations in secondary care, with most patients conservatively managed.

AB  - Busy hospital emergency rooms are concerned with shortening the waiting times of patients, with relieving overburdened physicians, and with reducing the number of mistakes made by triage nurses. Here we propose a software agent, dubbed TIA (Triage Information Agent) that, via dialogue in English, would gather both logistical and medical information from a patient for later use by the triage nurse. TIA would also give tentative, possible diagnoses to the triage nurse, along with recommendations for non-physician care. The IDA Technology makes a software agent such as TIA feasible, at least in principle.

AB  - Objective: To develop a custom-built, computer-based clinical decision-support tool to help determine the underlying cause of the patient's clinical presentation, its severity level and predicted outcome. Materials and Methods: A novel, customized, computer-based decision-support tool, rooted in the Bayesian Network technology was constructed. Based on documented data from patients' medical records, the probabilistic predictive model was utilized to validate patients' triage in two different clinical scenarios: 1. Prediction of neurologic deficits in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest following an Acute Coronary Syndrome/ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (ACS/STEMI), and thus likelihood of benefit from (or futility of) emergent coronary revascularization. Study group consisted of 99 patients resuscitated from NSTEMI. For this particular study, the endpoints were in-hospital death, neurologic recovery and the accurate prediction of outcomes by the program. 2. Prediction of the likelihood of presence of and readmission for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure syndrome. Study groups consisted of 20 randomly generated patient clinical profiles (Phase I) and 100 cases from our emergency room electronic medical records: 55 cases of acute heart failure, 14 cases of pneumonia, 7 cases of COPD exacerbation and 11 cases of "other" conditions. End points were the accurate prediction of the underlying diagnosis and the correct disposition. In both studies, observed data from our institutional electronic medical records registry was utilized to populate the computer program and to validate its initial results. Subsequently, multiple, random clinical case scenarios were used to validate the predictive properties of the computer tool (Phase I) Finally (Phase II), the program was tested using real-world data from our institutional emergency room electronic medical records. Results: First study: Overall, 64 (65%) patients survived, while 35 (35%) died. On initial examination, 25% of patients were alert, 14% were minimally responsive and 60% were unresponsive. First Group (5 Hypothetical Case scenarios): Diagnostic accuracy rate 4/5 (80%) Study Cohort (99 cases) 95/99% (95%); Overall Accuracy: 87% Second study: Phase I: Diagnostic accuracy rate of 85%; Disposition accuracy rate of 80%; Overall Accuracy rate 82% Phase II: Diagnostic accuracy rate of 98%; Disposition accuracy rate of 91%; Overall accuracy rate of 94% Conclusions: A custom-built, computer based predictive model, utilizing a probability engine software and based on population-wide real-life clinical data, can be a useful adjunct in clinical decision making and medical triage. This takes special significance in such high-risk, fast-paced environments such as the emergency department and the intensive care unit.

AB  - To choose the appropriate resources for their healthcare needs (primary care (GP) or emergency department (ED)), patients seeking acute care must self-triage based on their own assessments of symptoms and severity. However, as patients typically lack sufficient medical knowledge, self-triage decisions can often be inaccurate. In response, healthcare and technology companies have been developing and deploying AI-powered virtual triage tools designed to help patients make better self-triage decisions. To date, however, the operational implications of such tools have not been assessed. This paper therefore develops a queueing game model to investigate the impact of virtual triage in the acute care setting and potential policies to maximize its efficacy. We find that, due to its decentralized nature, when virtual triage excessively recommends emergency (primary) care, it counterintuitively brings about a decrease in ED (GP) visits. Another important finding is that in an unregulated environment, the adoption of informative virtual triage can worsen system performance, even when the virtual triage recommendation is reasonably accurate. Building on these insights, we identify two sources of inefficiency and propose associated policy actions that can help unlock the potential operational benefits of virtual triage.

AB  - Background: Emergence of more autonomous roles for physiotherapists warrants more evidence regarding their diagnostic capabilities. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate diagnostic and surgical triage concordance between a physiotherapist and expert physicians and to assess the diagnostic validity of the physiotherapist's musculoskeletal examination (ME) without imaging. Methods: This is a prospective diagnostic study where 179 consecutive participants consulting for any knee complaint were independently diagnosed and triaged by two evaluators: a physiotherapist and one expert physician (orthopaedic surgeons or sport medicine physicians). The physiotherapist completed only a ME, while the physicians also had access to imaging to make their diagnosis. Raw agreement proportions and Cohen's kappa (k) were calculated to assess inter-rater agreement. Sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp), as well as positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+/-) were calculated to assess the validity of the ME compared to the physicians' composite diagnosis. Results: Primary knee diagnoses included anterior cruciate ligament injury (n = 8), meniscal injury (n = 36), patellofemoral pain (n = 45) and osteoarthritis (n = 79). Diagnostic inter-rater agreement between the physiotherapist and physicians was high (k = 0.89; 95% CI:0.83-0.94). Inter-rater agreement for triage recommendations of surgical candidates was good (k = 0.73; 95% CI:0.60-0.86). Se and Sp of the physiotherapist's ME ranged from 82.0 to 100.0% and 96.0 to 100.0% respectively and LR+/- ranged from 23.2 to 30.5 and from 0.03 to 0.09 respectively. Conclusions: There was high diagnostic agreement and good triage concordance between the physiotherapist and physicians. The ME without imaging may be sufficient to diagnose or exclude common knee disorders for a large proportion of patients. Replication in a larger study will be required as well as further assessment of innovative multidisciplinary care trajectories to improve care of patients with common musculoskeletal disorders.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to elicit the components of diagnostic reasoning utilized by experienced triage nurses when making triage dispositions via the telephone. Five first‐level nurses triaged two simulated calls portrayed by the author. The resultant interactions were recorded on an answer‐phone and subsequently replayed to the relevant participant. The tape was stopped after each question or comment made by the nurse who was then asked to say what she was thinking at the time. These verbalizations were audio‐taped, transcribed and subjected to analysis using grounded theory. Although deprived of the opportunity for methodical deliberation, nurses, when making decisions, did so within a systematic and identifiable framework. The process was found to centre around five major considerations; the most likely cause of the presenting problem, the impact of the problem upon the caller, the accessibility of alternative sources of health care, the ability of the nurse to control the reactions of the caller and the nurses' perception of their vulnerability. The final triage disposition was made through balancing the most probable outcome against the worst possible outcome. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Background: Lung transplantation is now a standard intervention for patients with advanced lung disease. Home monitoring of pulmonary function and symptoms has been used to follow the progress of lung transplant recipients in an effort to improve care and clinical status. The study objective was to determine the relative performance of a computer-based Bayesian algorithm compared with a manual nurse decision process for triaging clinical intervention in lung transplant recipients participating in a home monitoring program. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial had 65 lung transplant recipients assigned to either the Bayesian or nurse triage study arm. Subjects monitored and transmitted spirometry and respiratory symptoms daily to the data center using an electronic spirometer/diary device. Subjects completed the Short Form-36 (SF-36) survey at baseline and after 1 year. End points were change from baseline after 1 year in forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) and quality of life (SF-36 scales) within and between each study arm. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between groups in FEV 1 or SF-36 scales at baseline or after 1 year.: Results were comparable between nurse and Bayesian system for detecting changes in spirometry and symptoms, providing support for using computer-based triage support systems as remote monitoring triage programs become more widely available. Conclusions: The feasibility of monitoring critical patient data with a computer-based decision system is especially important given the likely economic constraints on the growth in the nurse workforce capable of providing these early detection triage services. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Remote healthcare centers located in sub-Saharan of Africa are still facing a shortage of healthcare practitioners, yielding long queue of patients in waiting rooms during several hours. This situation increases the risk that critical patients are consulted too late, motivating the importance of priority-based patient scheduling systems. This paper presents the design of a Multi-Priority Triage Chair (MPTC) to be installed at the entrance of patient's waiting rooms such that each new patient first sits in the MPTC to measure its vital signs and register his/her other priority parameters such as arrival time, travel time or distance between the concerned center and its home, and so on. The proposed MPTC will then update in real-time the consultation planning in order to statistically minimize (i) the number of critical patients not treated within a pre-defined waiting time, (ii) the number of patients waiting for more than a pre-defined period and (iii) the number of patients living relatively far who gets their consultation postponed to another day.

AB  - "Triage" is a useful tool used in emergency departments (EDs) to prioritize the care of patients. Through a methodical process of different sequential steps, the triage nurse assigns a color code which goes from red-critical patient with immediate access to medical examination-to a white code that represents no urgency. Clinical studies have shown that patients can be victims of errors during the process of care, especially in complex systems such as EDs. To reduce errors it is essential to map the risks in order to identify the causes (both individual and organizational); the introduction of corrective changes cannot be postponed. The incorrect assessment at triage represents one of the major errors in EDs. By monitoring this activity, through the analysis of sentinel events we can reduce adverse consequences. Missed recognition of a red code indicates a sentinel event. We used a "root cause analysis" to explain an episode of missed recognition of red code at triage. A nurse without specific training in triage and inexperienced in critical care was identified as the "root cause" of the sentinel event. To make improvements we planned a triage training course (for newly employed nurses and a refresher course for existing staff) and created a team of dedicated triage nurses. © 2011 SIMI.

AB  - Adequate field triage of trauma patients is crucial to transport patients to the right hospital. Mistriage and subsequent interhospital transfers should be minimized to reduce avoidable mortality, life-long disabilities, and costs. Availability of a prehospital triage tool may help to identify patients in need of specialized trauma care and to determine the optimal transportation destination. The GOAT (Gradient Boosted Trauma Triage) study is a prospective, multi-site, cross-sectional diagnostic study. Patients transported by at least five ground Emergency Medical Services to any receiving hospital within the Netherlands are eligible for inclusion. The reference standards for the need of specialized trauma care are an Injury Severity Score ≥ 16 and early critical resource use, which will both be assessed by trauma registrars after the final diagnosis is made. Variable selection will be based on ease of use in practice and clinical expertise. A gradient boosting decision tree algorithm will be used to develop the prediction model. Model accuracy will be assessed in terms of discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (intercept, slope, and plot) on individual participant’s data from each participating cluster (i.e., Emergency Medical Service) through internal-external cross-validation. A reference model will be externally validated on each cluster as well. The resulting model statistics will be investigated, compared, and summarized through an individual participant’s data meta-analysis. The GOAT study protocol describes the development of a new prediction model for identifying patients in need of specialized trauma care. The aim is to attain acceptable undertriage rates and to minimize mortality rates and life-long disabilities.

AB  - Telephone triage: how experienced nurses reach decisions The purpose of this study was to elicitqhe components of diagnostic reasoning utilized by experienced triage nurses when making triage dispositions via the telephone. Five first-level nurses triaged two simulated calls portrayed by the author. The resultant interactions were recorded on an answer-phone and subsequently replayed to the relevant participant. The tape was stopped after each question or comment made by the nurse who was then asked to say what s h e was thinlung at the time. These verbalizations were audio-taped, transcribed and subjected to analysis using grounded theory. Although deprived of the opportunity for methodical deliberation, nurses, when making decisions, did so within a systematic and identifiable framework. The process was found to centre around five major considerations; the most likely cause of the presenting problem, the impact of the problem upon the caller, the accessibility of alternative sources of health care, the ability of the nurse to control the reactions of the caller and the nurses' perception of their vulnerability. The final triage disposition was made through balancing the most probable outcome against the worst possible outcome.

AB  - A reliable and fast instrument for prehospital detection of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke would be a game-changer in stroke care, because it would enable direct transportation of LVO stroke patients to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for endovascular treatment. This strategy would substantially improve treatment times and thus clinical outcomes of patients. Here, we outline our view on the requirements of an effective prehospital LVO detection method, namely: high diagnostic accuracy; fast application and interpretation; user-friendliness; compactness; and low costs. We argue that existing methods for prehospital LVO detection, including clinical scales, mobile stroke units and transcranial Doppler, do not fulfill all criteria, hindering broad implementation of these methods. Instead, electroencephalography may be suitable for prehospital LVO detection since in-hospital studies have shown that quantification of hypoxia-induced changes in the electroencephalography signal have good diagnostic accuracy for LVO stroke. Although performing electroencephalography measurements in the prehospital setting comes with challenges, solutions for fast and simple application of this method are available. Currently, the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of electroencephalography in the prehospital setting are being investigated in clinical trials.

AB  - Executive Summary CovidX triage software is built for remote screening, surveillance, and management of COVID-19. The application uses personalized machine learning algorithms trained off of clinical characteristic data from China, the EU, The Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan, and the USA in tandem with prescribed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and Zeijang University's handbook on COVID-19 prevention to: 1) assess progression of viral illness by identifying when new symptoms/signs are clinically significant, 2) provide efficient continuous home monitoring to improve health outcomes and inform work-from-home strategies, 3) pre-screen concerned people for COVID-19 testing, and 4) provide real-time decision support for early intervention and reduction of unnecessary healthcare utilization. The ML disease severity algorithms were validated in out-of-sample tests using the aforementioned patient characteristic data. Lung disease exacerbation detection and decision support algorithms were validated by comparison to pulmonary specialist opinion panels to show superior performance at identifying respiratory flare-ups and recommending the appropriate care. Prior clinical studies of mobile apps integrated with chronic lung disease algorithms have yielded clinically significant health improvement with as little as 4-5 minutes of weekly use. This product is freely available and could dramatically improve COVID-19 population health outcomes and containment via at-home triage, pre-screening for virus testing, and targeted remote monitoring.

AB  - Objective: To design and implement a system that supports emergency triage of various types of acute pain at the point of care through the use of handheld computers. Design: Developmental process and evaluation in a non-randomised clinical trial. Setting: The system known as Mobile Emergency Triage (MET) was used and evaluated by physicians in the Emergency Department (ED) of a pediatric teaching hospital in Canada. Methods: MET is designed following the extended client-server architecture where a client takes over some functions of the server when a connection is not available. The MET server interacts with the hospital information system to retrieve information about patients admitted to the ED. It also stores current patients' demographic and clinical data to be exchanged with mobile clients. The MET mobile client, running on a handheld computer, is used for collecting clinical data and supporting triage decisions. MET was clinically evaluated in a pediatric teaching hospital where it was used to support triage of patients with abdominal pain. The objectives of the trial were to validate the usefulness of the system in clinical practice, and to compare its triage accuracy with that achieved by physicians. The trial lasted for 7 months, and involved over 100 ED physicians and 574 patients. Results: Physicians found the system easy to use and were satisfied with its design allowing direct use at the bedside and its clear, intuitive interface. Patients found the MET system acceptable as it did not introduce additional tests or examinations and did not lengthen the time spent in the ED. The accuracy of the system was comparable to the accuracy of physicians (65.4% vs. 70.2%), and for the patients requiring specialist consultation (most critical group), MET and physicians demonstrated the same performance. Conclusion: Due to implementation on handheld computers and working in weak-con-nectivity conditions, the MET system is very well suited for use in the ED and fits seamlessly into the regular clinical workflow. The system facilitates patient-centred service and timely, high quality patient management. It provides recommendations using a limited amount of clinical data, normally available at the point of care. Furthermore, it offers the possibility for structured evaluation of these data by an attending physician. The clinical trial of the system proved its usefulness in clinical practice. Moreover, performance of the MET system was very close to that of experienced ED physicians, supporting our hypothesis that it is possible to build a clinical support system that effectively triages patients using a limited amount of information. / JITH2(4) Michalowski et al 29/7/04, 15:10 1

AB  - Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a web-based tele-triage system was created to prioritize in-person clinic visits and ensure safety at the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences during a statewide shelter-in-place order. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the tele-triage system on urgent visit volume and explore the characteristics of acute visit requests at a tertiary referral eye center. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed acute visit requests between April 6, 2020 and June 6, 2020. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, ANOVA, and bivariate logistic regression were used to compare variables with a p-value of 0.05. Results: Three hundred fifty-eight surveys were completed. Mean age was 49.7 ± 18.8 years (range 2–91). The majority of requests were determined as urgent (63.0%) or emergent (0.8%). Forty-nine patients had recent eye trauma (13.7%), and the most common reported symptoms were new onset eye pain (25.7%) and photophobia (22.9%). Most patients were self-referred (63.7%), though provider referral was more common in patients with symptoms of new onset lid swelling (p < 0.01), diplopia (p < 0.01), flashing lights (p = 0.02), or droopy eyelid (p < 0.01). Patients presenting with symptom onset within 48 h tended to be younger (45.8 years) versus those with symptom duration of 48 h to 1 week (49.6 years), or more than 1 week (52.6 years; p < 0.01). Conclusion: This novel tele-triage system screened out one-third of acute visit requests as non-urgent, which limited in-person visits during the initial shelter-in-place period of the pandemic. Tele-triage systems should be implemented in eye care practices for future emergency preparedness.

AB  - Although much deep learning research has focused on mammographic detection of breast cancer, relatively little attention has been paid to mammography triage for radiologist review. The purpose of this study was to develop and test DeepCAT, a deep learning system for mammography triage based on suspicion of cancer. Specifically, we evaluate DeepCAT’s ability to provide two augmentations to radiologists: (1) discarding images unlikely to have cancer from radiologist review and (2) prioritization of images likely to contain cancer. We used 1878 2D-mammographic images (CC & MLO) from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography to develop DeepCAT, a deep learning triage system composed of 2 components: (1) mammogram classifier cascade and (2) mass detector, which are combined to generate an overall priority score. This priority score is used to order images for radiologist review. Of 595 testing images, DeepCAT recommended low priority for 315 images (53%), of which none contained a malignant mass. In evaluation of prioritizing images according to likelihood of containing cancer, DeepCAT’s study ordering required an average of 26 adjacent swaps to obtain perfect review order. Our results suggest that DeepCAT could substantially increase efficiency for breast imagers and effectively triage review of mammograms with malignant masses.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated the performance of individual trauma triage criteria using data from a regional trauma registry. Methods: Los Angeles County (LAC) paramedics use triage criteria adapted from the 2011 Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines to triage injured patients to Trauma Centers (TCs). TCs report outcomes to a LAC EMS registry. We abstracted data for patients 15 years or older from 2013 to 2015 and identified all trauma triage criteria that were met for each encounter. Study outcomes were: (1) “clear need” for a TC, defined as receiving a non-orthopedic operative intervention within 6 hours of arrival, injury severity score (ISS) > 15, or surgical ICU admission; or (2) “no need” for a TC, defined as discharge home from the emergency department (ED). We also defined “possible need” as those patients not discharged home from the ED, inclusive of “clear need” and all other admitted patients. For each individual triage criteria, we calculated the positive likelihood ratios and positive predictive values for TC need. Results: There were 71,536 adult patients in the registry transported by EMS to a LAC TC during the study. Median age was 38 years (IQR 25–55) with 73% male. There were 23,628 (33%) who met “no need” criteria for a TC, leaving 47,908 (67%) patients with “possible need” for a TC, of whom 13,343 patients (19% of total) met “clear need” for a TC. No individual trauma criterion met the a priori likelihood ratio threshold of 10 for predicting “clear need” for a TC. Cardiopulmonary arrest with penetrating torso trauma and flail chest met this threshold for “possible need.” Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis, no individual triage criterion definitively identified patients who benefit from transport to a TC. Yet, the majority of patients demonstrated potential benefit for nearly all criteria, supporting CDC recommendations that trauma triage criteria be considered in their entirety, not as individual criterion.

AB  - Background The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected academic ophthalmology departments globally, causing changes in educational, research, and clinical operations in the short and long term. Healthcare workers are at higher risk of contracting the disease and given early reports suggestive of transmission through the tear film in COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis, and close proximity during examination, eye care providers in particular may be at increased risk.Objective To provide the experience from a single academic ophthalmology program in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods This article describes the changes executed in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, with emphasis on the implementation of a tele-triage process for urgent visits.Results In response to the pandemic, our department made rapid changes to its departmental protocols for education, research, and patient management. Early measures focused on limiting face-to-face interactions among patients, staff, residents, and faculty, decreasing the risk of exposure to disease while also providing access for patients in urgent need of care.Conclusion We hope that the UIC experience will assist other academic tertiary referral centers in maximizing their opportunities to deliver excellent patient care while minimizing risks to patient and provider, all while continuing to provide a quality graduate medical educational experience during and beyond the pandemic.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the use of an imaging selection tool, multiphase computed tomographic (CT) angiography, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to demonstrate its interrater reliability and ability to help determine clinical outcome. Materials and Methods: The local ethics board approved this study. Data are from the pilot phase of PRoveIT, a prospective observational study analyzing utility of multimodal imaging in the triage of patients with AIS. Patients underwent baseline unenhanced CT, single-phase CT angiography of the head and neck, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT. Multiphase CT angiography generates time-resolved images of pial arteries. Pial arterial filling was scored on a six-point ordinal scale, and interrater reliability was tested. Clinical outcomes included a 50% or greater decrease in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) over 24 hours and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. The ability to predict clinical outcomes was compared between single-phase CT angiography, multiphase CT angiography, and perfusion CT by using receiver operating curve analysis, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results: A total of 147 patients were included. Interrater reliability for multiphase CT angiography is excellent (n = 30, k = 0.81, P < .001). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the ability to predict clinical outcome is modest (C statistic = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52, 0.63 for ≥50% decrease in NIHSS over 24 hours; C statistic = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.68 for 90-day mRS score of 0-2) but better than that of models using single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT (P < .05 overall). With AIC and BIC, models that use multiphase CT angiography are better than models that use single-phase CT angiography and perfusion CT for a decrease of 50% or more in NIHSS over 24 hours (AIC = 166, BIC = 171.7; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography) and a 90-day mRS score of 0-2 (AIC = 132.1, BIC = 137.4; values were lowest for multiphase CT angiography). Conclusion: Multiphase CT angiography is a reliable tool for imaging selection in patients with AIS.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate imaging patterns of a COVID-19 infection of the lungs on chest radiographs and their value in discriminating this infection from other viral pneumonias. Materials and Methods All 321 patients who presented with respiratory impairment suspicious for COVID-19 infection between February 3 and May 8, 2020 and who received a chest radiograph were included in this analysis. Imaging findings were classified as typical for COVID-19 (bilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations), non-typical (findings consistent with lobar pneumonia), indeterminate (all other distribution patterns of opacifications/consolidations), or none (no opacifications/consolidations). The sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive value for the diagnostic value of the category typical were determined. Chi² test was used to compare the pattern distribution between the different types of pneumonia. Results Imaging patterns defined as typical for COVID-19 infections were documented in 35/111 (31.5%) patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection but only in 4/210 (2%) patients with any other kind of pneumonia, resulting in a sensitivity of 31.5%, a specificity of 98.1%, and a positive and negative predictive value of 89.7% or 73%, respectively. The sensitivity could be increased to 45.9% when defining also unilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations with no relevant pathology contralaterally as consistent with a COVID-19 infection, while the specificity decreases slightly to 93.3%. The pattern distribution between COVID-19 patients and those with other types of pneumonia differed significantly (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Although the moderate sensitivity does not allow the meaningful use of chest radiographs as part of primary screening, the specific pattern of findings in a relevant proportion of those affected should be communicated quickly as additional information and trigger appropriate protective measures. Key Points: COVID-19 infections show specific X-ray image patterns in 1/3 of patients. Bilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations are typical imaging patterns. Unilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations should also raise suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Citation Format Kasper J, Decker J, Wiesenreiter K et al.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT) brain imaging is routinely used to support clinical decision-making in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Only 7% of scans, however, demonstrate evidence of TBI. The other 93% of scans contribute a significant cost to the healthcare system and a radiation risk to patients. There may be better strategies to identify which patients, particularly those with mild TBI, are at risk of deterioration and require hospital admission. We introduce a blood serum liquid biopsy that utilizes attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with machine learning algorithms as a decision-making tool to identify which patients with mild TBI will most likely present with a positive CT scan. Serum samples were obtained from patients (n = 298) patients who had acquired a TBI and were enrolled in CENTER-TBI and from asymptomatic control patients (n = 87). Injury patients (all severities) were stratified against non-injury controls. The cohort with mild TBI was further examined by stratifying those who had at least one CT abnormality against those who had no CT abnormalities. The test performed exceptionally well in classifications of patients with mild injury versus non-injury controls (sensitivity = 96.4% and specificity = 98.0%) and also provided a sensitivity of 80.2% when stratifying mild patients with at least one CT abnormality against those without. The results provided illustrate the test ability to identify four of every five CT abnormalities and show great promise to be introduced as a triage tool for CT priority in patients with mild TBI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The correct interpretation of the ECG is pivotal for the accurate diagnosis of many cardiac abnormalities, and conventional computerized interpretation has not been able to reach physician-level accuracy in detecting (acute) cardiac abnormalities. This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a 37-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data set of free-text physician-annotated 12-lead ECGs. The deep neural network was trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists electrophysiologists. The 12-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and category-specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3% were men. The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall concordance statistic of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92–0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory index of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79–0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an end-to-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-text physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-lead ECGs. When further fine-tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical practice, the demonstrated deep learning–based ECG interpretation can potentially improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.

AB  - Objective: Triage can create an ethical slippery slope when providing prehospital emergency health care. In triage decisions, emergency management is like the idiom of "herding cats", which refers to managing or controlling the chaos and organizing people toward common goals. The purpose of this literature review is to explore the ethical framework of prehospital triage and to provide a critical view of the subject. Methods: Published materials related to "triage", "ethics", and "prehospital emergency medicine" were extracted from online databases and books from 1985 until February 2021. The papers were handled in seven themes including the historical basis, the importance of the triage, ethical considerations in prehospital triage, justice, assessment and decision-making, the variability of triage assessment criteria, and the reliability of triage decisions. Except for the historical basis and the importance of triage, the other five groups were discussed with an ethical critique of the content. The methodology in this article is based on a critical interpretation of discussions on triage through ethical approaches. Results: There are three basic ethical approaches to triage: utilitarianism, beneficence, and justice. Due to the historical military basis of triage, results-focused approaches have become more prominent. Ethical values in prehospital triage include the issues of human rights, moral rights, social justice, and beneficence. Ethical difficulties in triage decision-making involve vulnerability, limited resources, the concern of safety, the urgency of the situation, and instability. Triage decisions may be affected by subjective approaches such as the personal values and beliefs of the decision-makers. Conclusions: Three predominant ethical concepts in triage are utilitarianism, beneficence, and justice. The unique dynamics of the field influence triage decision-making in a variety of ways. The way triage is structured makes it more amenable to subjective influences. Considering the differences in prehospital triage models and approaches, there is an important need for an ethical framework that expresses clear values and principles that will guide prehospital emergency caregivers. In this paper, it is suggested that an ethical framework should include the following six headings: basic bioethical principles, distributing scarce resources, decision-making process, community support, assessment criteria, and promote the common good.

AB  - Triage management plays important roles in hospitalized patients for disease severity stratification and medical burden analysis. Although progression risks have been extensively researched for numbers of diseases, other crucial indicators that reflect patients' economic and time costs have not been systematically studied. To address the problems, we developed an automatic deep learning based Auto Triage Management (ATM) Framework capable of accurately modelling patients' disease progression risk and health economic evaluation. Based on them, we can first discover the relationship between disease progression and medical system cost, find potential features that can more precisely aid patient triage in resource allocation, and allow treatment plan searching that has cured patients. Applying ATM in COVID-19, we built a joint model to predict patients' risk, the total length of stay (LoS) and cost when at-admission, and remaining LoS and cost at a given hospitalized time point, with C-index 0.930 and 0.869 for risk prediction, mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.61 and 5.90 days for total LoS prediction in internal and external validation data. patient triage, AutoML, electronic medical records Citation: Zhong, Q., Li, Z., Wang, W., Zhang, L., and He, K.

AB  - Objectives: Identifying high-risk heart failure (HF) patients at hospital discharge may allow more effective triage to management strategies. Background: Heart failure severity at presentation predicts outcomes, but the prognostic importance of clinical status changes due to interventions is less well described. Methods: Predictive models using variables obtained during hospitalization were created using data from the ESCAPE (Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness) trial and internally validated by the bootstrapping method. Model coefficients were converted to an additive risk score. Additionally, data from FIRST (Flolan International Randomized Survival Trial) was used to externally validate this model. Results: Patients discharged with complete data (n = 423) had 6-month mortality and death and rehospitalization rates of 18.7% and 64%, respectively. Discharge risk factors for mortality included BNP, per doubling (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 1.75), cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mechanical ventilation during hospitalization (HR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.12 to 5.78), blood urea nitrogen, per 20-U increase (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.55), serum sodium, per unit increase (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.99), age >70 years (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.51 to 2.17), daily loop diuretic, furosemide equivalents >240 mg (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.68 to 3.26), lack of beta-blocker (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.68 to 2.41), and 6-min walk, per 100-foot increase (HR: 0.955, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.00; c-index 0.76). A simplified discharge score discriminated mortality risk from 5% (score = 0) to 94% (score = 8). Bootstrap validation demonstrated good internal validation of the model (c-index 0.78, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.83). Conclusions: The ESCAPE study discharge risk model and score refine risk assessment after in-hospital therapy for advanced decompensated systolic HF, allowing clinicians to focus surveillance and triage for early life-saving interventions in this high-risk population.

AB  - ii Abstract. Each person faces a health problem differently. Many people tend to visit an emergency department immediately without any regards to the scale of acuity of their disorder. Some of these visits are not necessary and hence lead to overcrowding of emergency departments, increase patients' waiting time, and ultimately lead to overutilization of healthcare resources. At the other end of the spectrum, some people do not visit their physician when they should. One solution to this problem is to provide a reliable source of information that would allow people to assess their health condition (self-triage) in a way that helps reduce the number of inappropriate visits and promote warranted visits to emergency departments. This research proposes a new and user-friendly self-triage mobile application called Symptoms Pal, which allows lay people to use their health data to assess the presence of potential health concerns. Using diagnostic algorithms developed by physicians on the basis of medical evidence, the application requires users to answer a short series of questions about their symptoms. Symptoms Pal then provides some basic information about the possible problem and aims to inform users about whether they should seek immediate medical attention such as visiting an emergency department, or see a family doctor, or do self-care. The usability of Symptoms Pal was evaluated by conducting a study involving 34 participants. Several strengths and weaknesses of the usability and perceived usefulness of the application were identified and led to a revised version and additional recommendations. The thesis contributes 25 reusable requirements and validated user interface design artefacts for self-triage mobile applications. Acknowledgment

LEARNING OUTCOME AND OBJECTIVES: Upon completion of this course, you will have increased your knowledge of telephone triage nursing. Specific objectives to address potential knowledge gaps include: • Define "telephone triage" and its related terminology. • Discuss the components of a high-quality telephone triage system. • Summarize the essential aspects of good communication required for telephone triage. • Identify how telephone triage decision-making is influenced by rules of thumb, distractors, and cognitive biases. • Describe mnemonic tools used in patient and symptom assessment. • List the essentials of safe, effective, and appropriate documentation specific to telephone triage care. • Discuss patient disposition and the use of telephone triage guidelines. • Summarize common risk management issues in telephone triage practice. WHAT IS TELEPHONE TRIAGE? Telephone triage is a complex process by which trained clinicians identify a patient's problem, estimate the level of urgency, and render advice to the patient over the phone (Haddad et al., 2019). Telephone triage, however, does not involve making diagnoses-nursing or medical-by phone (ANA, 2019).

AB  - (p=0.15). There was no significant difference in the duration of ventricular pause between ATP and adenosine (mean 13.6±13.1 vs. 9.6±2.8 s; median 8.2 vs. 8.5 s; p=0.32). Only 7 (58%) patients with positive ATP test had also a positive adeno-sine test (Figure). Six of these patients had similar responses (AVB in 5 patients, sinus arrest in 1 patient) with significantly longer pauses induced by adenosine (11.1±3.3 vs. 7.8±1.0 s; p=0.037). Asystolic pauses >10 s were observed in 3 patients during ATP and 3 patients during adenosine testing. In none of these patients both tests resulted in a pause >10 s. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that electrocardiographic responses to adenosine and ATP testing do not well correlate in an individual patient. Because of its known selective action on AV nodal cells, adenosine may be more specific than ATP to identify patients with paroxysmal AVB who benefit from cardiac pacing. Further investigation is needed to validate this hypothesis. Background: Cardiac syncope heralds significantly higher mortality compared with syncope due to non-cardiac causes or unknown aetiologies, which is commonly considered a benign event. Nonetheless, previous studies have investigated the outcome of syncope of different aetiological subgroups, rather than comparing matched patient groups with and without syncope. Therefore, little is known about prognosis of patients with non-cardiac syncope compared with syncope-free population. Purpose: To determine whether non-cardiac syncope is associated with increased mortality. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature by searching for prospective observational studies reporting multivariable adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all-cause mortality in participants with history of non-cardiac syncope (regardless of site of presentation, i.e. inpatient or outpatient) compared with syncope-free participants. Hazard ratios were pooled in a random-effect, generic inverse variance meta-analysis in order to compute summary effect size. Results: We identified a total of 4 studies, including an overall population of 287,382 individuals (51.6% men; age, 64.5±12.4 years), 38,843 with history of non-cardiac syncope and 248,539 without history of syncope. The average follow-up was 2.9 years. Compared with controls, history of non-cardiac syncope was associated with increased all-cause mortality (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.23). Forest plot for all-cause mortality Conclusions: Non-cardiac syncope is associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality in the adult general population. Background: Essential hypertension (HTN), defined as an office blood pressure (BP) ≥140/90 with no identifiable cause, is a well-documented risk factor for car-diovascular disease. As such, current guidelines advocate pharmacological treatment if lifestyle measures are insufficient. In the majority of cases, a diagnosis of HTN is based only on office blood pressure recordings, which have been shown to be susceptible to the "white-coat" effect whereby readings are higher when checked in a healthcare environment than if checked via an average daytime BP. Purpose: We hypothesise that a cohort of patients who present with syncope do so as a result of orthostatic hypotension secondary to either over-or erroneously-treated HTN, and that a reduction in the number of anti-hypertensive agents used can improve their symptoms. Methods: Data was collected retrospectively from attendances to a specialist syncope clinic between January 2016-January 2017 at a teaching hospital within the UK. Patients who presented with syncope or pre-syncope whilst on treatment for HTN, and in whom a comparison between office BP and daytime ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) demonstrated a white coat effect (difference ≥20/10mmHg) were eligible for inclusion into this study. Once a white coat effect had been demonstrated, patients had ≥1 anti-hypertensive agent withdrawn and a repeat daytime ABPM period undertaken 3 months later to assess for HTN (de

With the increase in problem complexity, more causal explanations were found, and the decisions were more often inaccurate. Fur thermore, the explanations supporting the accurate decisions were often inaccurate, showing a decoupling of knowledge and action.

AB  - Objective: A tiered trauma team activation system allocates resources proportional to patients’ needs based upon injury burden. Previous trauma hospital-triage models are limited to predicting Injury Severity Score which is based on > 10% all-cause in-hospital mortality, rather than need for emergent intervention within 6 hours (NEI-6). Our aim was to develop a novel prediction model for hospital-triage that utilizes criteria available to the EMS provider to predict NEI-6 and the need for a trauma team activation. Methods: A regional trauma quality collaborative was used to identify all trauma patients ≥ 16 years from the American College of Surgeons-Committee on Trauma verified Level 1 and 2 trauma centers. Logistic regression and random forest were used to construct two predictive models for NEI-6 based on clinically relevant variables. Restricted cubic splines were used to model nonlinear predictors. The accuracy of the prediction model was assessed in terms of discrimination. Results: Using data from 12,624 patients for the training dataset (62.6% male; median age 61 years; median ISS 9) and 9,445 patients for the validation dataset (62.6% male; median age 59 years; median ISS 9), the following significant predictors were selected for the prediction models: age, gender, field GCS, vital signs, intentionality, and mechanism of injury. The final boosted tree model showed an AUC of 0.85 in the validation cohort for predicting NEI-6. Conclusions: The NEI-6 trauma triage prediction model used prehospital metrics to predict need for highest level of trauma activation. Prehospital prediction of major trauma may reduce undertriage mortality and improve resource utilization.

The Copenhagen EMS operates two telephone line the 1-1-2 emergency number and the 1813 medical helpline. A separate coronavirus support track was implemented on the 1813 medical helpline and a web-based self-triage (web triage) system was created to reduce non-emergency call volume. The aim of this paper is to present call volume and the two measures implemented to handle the increased call volume to the Copenhagen EMS. Methods: This is a cross sectional observational study.

Skilled decision makers who have experience use specific decision heuristics about situations that are connected to their underlying knowledge of the domain. Subjects with less relevant experience, but with domain knowledge, exploit this knowledge to make decisions. This paper deals with experienced decision makers who have contextual knowledge of situations but limited knowledge of the underlying specific medical disorders. In Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the emergency medical services (EMS) system employed nurses as first-line responders to incoming health-related calls from the population transferred by the 9-1-1 operators. Although they could consult attending physicians when they needed to, the nurses were responsible for most of the decisions. Each decision involved assessing the urgency of each situation and determining the most appropriate intervention among six alternatives: 1) sending a physician and an ambulance immediately; 2) sending an ambulance immediately; 3) sending an ambulance within 20 minutes; 4) sending an ambulance within 45 minutes; 5) referral; and 6) advice. These decisions represent a hierarchy of alternate solutions associated with different levels of urgency. Situations of higher urgency can generate higher costs. Once made, each decision was implemented by a dispatcher who had current information about available resources. The nurses' training focused initially on the knowledge , abilities, and attitudes required for the task. The method for treating the calls, including ABCC assessment (airway, breathing, circulation, and level of consciousness), and the most frequent symptoms and problems encountered in this setting represented important elements of this program.

AB  - Automated medical image classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has great potential to impact healthcare, particularly in resource-constrained healthcare systems where fewer trained radiologists are available. However, little is known about how well a trained CNN can perform on images with the increased noise levels, different acquisition protocols, or additional arti-facts that may arise when using low-cost scanners, which can be underrepresented in datasets collected from well-funded hospitals. In this work, we investigate how a model trained to triage head computed tomography (CT) scans performs on images acquired with reduced x-ray tube current, fewer projections per gantry rotation , and limited angle scans. These changes can reduce the cost of the scanner and demands on electrical power but come at the expense of increased image noise and artifacts. We first develop a model to triage head CTs and report an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.77. We then show that the trained model is robust to reduced tube current and fewer projections, with the AUROC dropping only 0.65% for images acquired with a 16x reduction in tube current and 0.22% for images acquired with 8x fewer projections. Finally, for significantly degraded images acquired by a limited angle scan, we show that a model trained specifically to classify such images can overcome the technological limitations to reconstruction and maintain an AUROC within 0.09% of the original model.

AB  - Background: In mass casualty incidents (MCI), death usually occurs within the first few hours and thus early transfer to a trauma centre can be crucial in selected cases. However, most triage systems designed to prioritize the transfer to hospital of these patients do not assess the need for surgery, in part due to inconclusive evidence regarding the value of such an assessment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the capacity of a new triage system—the Prehospital Advanced Triage Method (META)—to identify victims who could benefit from urgent surgical assessment in case of MCI. Methods: Retrospective, descriptive, observational study of a multipurpose cohort of patients included in the severe trauma registry of the Gregorio Marañón University General Hospital (Spain) between June 1993 and December 2011. All data were prospectively evaluated. All patients were evaluated with the META system to determine whether they met the criteria for urgent transfer. The META defines patients in need of urgent surgical assessment: (a) All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso and extremities proximal to elbow or knee, (b) Open pelvic fracture, (c) Closed pelvic fracture with mechanical or haemodynamic instability and (d) Blunt torso trauma with haemodynamic instability. Patients who fulfilled these criteria were designated as “Urgent Evacuation for Surgical Assessment” (UESA) cases; all other cases were designated as non-UESA. The following variables were assessed: patient status at the scene; severity scales [RTS, Shock index, MGAP (Mechanism, Glasgow coma scale, Age, pressure), GCS]; need for surgery and/or interventional procedure to control bleeding (UESA); and mortality. The two groups (UESA vs. non-UESA) were then compared. Results: A total of 1882 cases from the database were included in the study. Mean age was 39.2 years and most (77%) patients were male. UESA patients presented significantly worse on-scene hemodynamic parameters (systolic blood pressure and heart rate) and greater injury severity (RTS, shock index, and MGAP scales). No differences were observed for respiratory rate, need for orotracheal intubation, or GCS scores. The anatomical injuries of patients in the UESA group were less severe but these patients had a greater need for urgent surgery and higher mortality rates. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the META triage classification system could be beneficial to help identify patients with severe trauma and/or in need of urgent surgical assessment at the scene of injury in case of MCI. These findings demonstrate that, in this cohort, the META fulfils the purpose for which it was designed.

AB  - Objective We describe the design, implementation, and validation of an online, publicly available tool to algorithmically triage patients experiencing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-like symptoms. Methods We conducted a chart review of patients who completed the triage tool and subsequently contacted our institution's phone triage hotline to assess tool- and clinician-assigned triage codes, patient demographics, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) test data, and health care utilization in the 30 days post-encounter. We calculated the percentage of concordance between tool- and clinician-assigned triage categories, down-triage (clinician assigning a less severe category than the triage tool), and up-triage (clinician assigning a more severe category than the triage tool) instances. Results From May 4, 2020 through January 31, 2021, the triage tool was completed 30,321 times by 20,930 unique patients. Of those 30,321 triage tool completions, 51.7% were assessed by the triage tool to be asymptomatic, 15.6% low severity, 21.7% moderate severity, and 11.0% high severity. The concordance rate, where the triage tool and clinician assigned the same clinical severity, was 29.2%. The down-triage rate was 70.1%. Only six patients were up-triaged by the clinician. 72.1% received a COVID-19 test administered by our health care system within 14 days of their encounter, with a positivity rate of 14.7%. Conclusion The design, pilot, and validation analysis in this study show that this COVID-19 triage tool can safely triage patients when compared with clinician triage personnel. This work may signal opportunities for automated triage of patients for conditions beyond COVID-19 to improve patient experience by enabling self-service, on-demand, 24/7 triage access.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from an event that causes rapid acceleration and deceleration of the brain or penetration of the skull with an object. Responses to stimuli and questions, loss of consciousness, and altered behavior are symptoms currently used to justify brain imaging for diagnosis and therapeutic guidance. Tests based on such symptoms are susceptible to false-positive and false-negative results due to stress, fatigue, and medications. Biochemical markers of neuronal damage and the physiological response to that damage are being identified. Biosensors capable of rapid measurement of such markers in the circulation offer a solution for on-site triage, as long as three criteria are met: (a) Recognition reagents can be identified that are sufficiently sensitive and specific, (b) the biosensor can provide quantitative assessment of multiple markers rapidly and simultaneously, and (c) both the sensor and reagents are designed for use outside the laboratory.

AB  - A new triage service was initiated in an acute trust in southwest England to assess women who presented with a problem in their pregnancy but who did not necessarily require admission to delivery suite. Questionnaires were used to obtain the views of women using triage and to identify areas which they thought were good practice and also identify those areas that required improvement. Data were analysed using the SNAP survey software which enabled basic features within the data to be described. Most women were happy with the amount of time they waited in triage which appears to negate the need for appointments. Women were satisfied with the amount of time they spent with the midwife and obstetrician and reported being treated with dignity and respect, although there were some problems relating to the triage environment.

AB  - Objective. The evaluation of peripheral vestibular disorders in clinical practice is an especially difficult endeavor, particularly for the inexperienced clinician. The goal of this systematic review is thus to evaluate the design, approaches, and outcomes for clinical vestibular symptom triage and decision support tools reported in contemporary published literature. Data Sources. A comprehensive search of existing literature in August 2020 was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE using terms of desired diagnostic tools such as algorithm, protocol, and questionnaire as well as an exhaustive set of terms to encompass vestibular disorders. Review Methods. Study characteristics, tool metrics, and performance were extracted using a standardized form. Quality assessment was conducted using a modified version of the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) assessment tool. Results. A total of 18 articles each reporting a novel tool for the evaluation of vestibular disorders were identified. Tools were organized into 3 discrete categories, including self-administered questionnaires, health care professional administered tools, and decision support systems. Most tools could differentiate between specific vestibular pathologies, with outcome measures including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Conclusion. A multitude of tools have been published to aid with the evaluation of vertiginous patients. Our systematic review identified several low-evidence reports of triage and decision support tools for the evaluation of vestibular disorders.

AB  - We used historical data and knowledge discovery techniques based on rough set theory to build a clinical decision algorithm for triaging patients with scrotal pain. As demonstrated in a limited retrospective evaluation, the algorithm allows for supporting early triage decisions on the basis of limited information, resulting in good triage accuracy and facilitating the use of scarce resources (specialist consults or laboratory tests). The scrotal pain algorithm is integrated as an application 1 This research was conducted while Dr. Wilk was Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Management, University of Ottawa. into an m-health decision support system called MET. The system is designed to fit into the emergency triage workflow-it is available directly at the point of care and interacts with the IT infrastructure of the hospital. This integrative approach to supporting clinical decision making demonstrates the benefits of coupling decision support and information technologies.

AB  - Current research indicates that more than half of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) experience delays in transfer and receive surgery >24 h post-injury. The objectives of this study were to determine the geographic distribution of tSCI in Canada relative to specialized treatment facilities, to assess clinical and logistical factors at play for indirect admissions to those facilities, and to explore differences in current time to admission and simulated scenarios in an attempt to assess the potential impact of changes to triage protocols. This study included data from 876 patients with tSCI enrolled in the prospectively collected acute Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013 for whom there were data on the location of their injury. Patients transported directly to a RHSCIR acute facility were more likely to reach the facility within 1 h of injury, whereas those transported indirectly were more likely to arrive 7 h later. Considering the injuries occurring within 40 km of a RHSCIR acute facility (n = 323), 249 patients (77%) were directly and 74 (23%) were indirectly admitted. In the multivariate regression analysis, only older age and longer road distance remained significantly associated with being indirectly admitted to a RHSCIR facility. Compared with the current status, the median time to admission decreased by 20% (3.5 h) in the 100% direct admission scenario, and increased by 102% (8.9 h) in the 100% indirect admission scenario.

AB  - Patient safety is a persistent problem in telephone triage research; however, studies have not differentiated between clinicians' and non-clinicians' respective safety. Currently, four groups of decision makers perform aspects of telephone triage: clinicians (physicians, nurses), and non-clinicians (emergency medical dispatchers (EMD) and clerical staff). Using studies published between 2002-2012, we applied Donabedian's structure-process-outcome model to examine groups' systems for evidence of system completeness (a minimum measure of structure and quality). We defined system completeness as the presence of a decision maker and four additional components: guidelines, documentation, training, and standards. Defining safety as appropriate referrals (AR)-(right time, right place with the right person), we measured each groups' corresponding AR rate percentages (outcomes). We analyzed each group's respective decision-making process as a safe match to the telephone triage task, based on each group's system structure completeness, process and AR rates (outcome). Studies uniformly noted system component presence: nurses (2-4), physicians (1), EMDs (2), clerical staff (1). Nurses had the highest average appropriate referral (AR) rates (91%), physicians' AR (82% average). Clerical staff had no system and did not perform telephone triage by standard definitions; EMDs may represent the use of the wrong system. Telephone triage appears least safe after hours when decision makers with the least complete systems (physicians, clerical staff) typically manage calls. At minimum, telephone triage decision makers should be clinicians; however, clinicians' safety calls for improvement. With improved training, standards and CDSS quality, the 24/7 clinical call center has potential to represent the national standard. 2

AB  - Biases influence the decisions people make in everyday life, even if they are unaware of it. This behavior transfers into social interactions in virtual environments. These systems are becoming an increasingly common platform for training, so it is critical to understand how biases will impact them. The present study investigates the effect of the ethnicity bias on error behaviors within a virtual world for medical triage training. Two between subjects variables, participant skin tone (light, dark) and avatar skin tone (light, dark), and one within subjects variable, agent/patient skin tone (light, dark), were manipulated to create a 2 × 2 × 2 mixed design with four conditions. Effects on errors were observed on errors made while helping patient (agents). Participants made considerably more errors while triaging dark-skinned agents which increased the amount of time spent on them, in comparison to light-skinned agents. Within a virtual world for training, people apply general ethnic biases against dark-skinned individuals, which is important to consider when designing such systems because the biases could impact the effectiveness of the training.

AB  - Nurses in pediatric oncology are often the main resource for overwhelmed parents and deal with complex patient issues over the telephone but often not without concerns about best patient care, liability, and accountability for the advice given. The question is whether using standardization of telephone triage practices can provide opportunities for improvement in the care of pediatric oncology patients. A review of the literature pertaining to telephone triage, standardization of practice, and the practice in outpatient oncology was conducted. The utilization of easy-to-use, accessible yet nonrestrictive resources and a well-designed documentation tool can help guide the decision-making process while addressing legal concerns and ensuring best possible patient care. An advantage that nurses in outpatient oncology settings have in performing telephone triage is the knowledge they have of their patient population and the disease process and treatments. Using a balanced approach to standardization of telephone triage practices can provide opportunities for improvements in care while still capitalizing on the intuitive knowledge and experience of the nurses involved.

AB  - Objective: To describe the operating characteristics, financial performance, and perceived value of computerized children's hospital-based telephone triage and advice (TTA) programs. Design: A written survey of all 32 children's hospital-based TTA programs in the United States that used the same proprietary pediatric TTA software product for at least 6 months. Main Outcome Measures: The expense, revenues, and perceived value of children's hospital-based TTA programs. Results: Of 30 programs (94%) responding, 27 (90%) were eligible for the study and reported on their experience with nearly 1.3 million TTA calls over a 12-month period. Programs provided pediatric TTA services for 1560 physicians, serving an average of 82 physicians (range, 10-340 physicians) and answering 38 880 calls (range, 8500-140 000 calls) annually. The mean call duration was 11.3 minutes and the estimated mean total expense per call was $12.45. Of programs charging fees for TTA services , 16 (59%) used a per-call fee and 7 (26%) used a monthly service fee. All respondents indicated that fees did not cover all associated costs. Telephone triage and advice programs, when examined on a stand-alone basis , were all operating with annual deficits (mean, $447 000; median, $325 000; range, $74 000-$1.3 million), supported by the sponsoring children's hospitals and their companion programs. Using a 3-point Likert scale, the TTA program managers rated the value of the TTA program very highly as a mechanism for marketing to physicians (2.85) and increasing physician (2.92) and patient (2.80) satisfaction. Conclusions: Children's hospital-based TTA programs operate at substantial financial deficits. Ongoing support of these programs may derive from the perception that they are a valuable mechanism for marketing and increase patient and physician satisfaction. Chil-dren's hospitals should develop strategies to ensure the long-term financial viability of TTA programs or they may have to discontinue these services.

AB  - Presently, urgent interventional treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is feasible not only for those with large artery occlusion (LAO) but also for others with more distal branch occlusions, encompassing various techniques for thrombectomy (i.e., direct clot removal), as well as additional techniques for flow restoration in cases with concurrent steno-occlusive pathology (e.g., angioplasty, stenting). However, the reasonableness of this type of treatment requires proper identification of patients considered High Value Targets (HVT) for urgent intervention. Ideally, a HVT patient is one with a clearly identified LAO that is manageable using available endovascular techniques, has a measurable and disabling neurologic deficit, and whose CT perfusion (CTP) map displays an ischemic core that is as small as possible accompanied by mismatch volume sufficiently large to warrant salvaging efforts.

The unique triage performed by Dr. Talzani explores the desirability of euthanasia in extreme situations. Also the post-traumatic stress disorder experienced by one of the characters is analyzed, as of the consequences experienced by those who survive to the horror of the war. Resumen A través de la película Triage (2009) de Danis Tanovic, este trabajo repasa las características del triaje y sus implicaciones éticas en el contexto bélico donde dos fotorreporteros intentan documentar la cruel-dad de la guerra.

AB  - Introduction: The opioid epidemic has altered normative clinical perceptions on addressing both acute and chronic pain, particularly within the Emergency Department (ED) setting, where providers are now confronted with balancing pain management and potential abuse. This study aims to examine patient sociodemographic and ED clinical characteristics to comprehensively determine predictors of opioid administration during an ED visit (ED-RX) and prescribing upon discharge (DC-RX)., Methods: ED visit data of patients >=18 years old from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2014 to 2017 were used. Opioid prescriptions were determined utilizing Lexicon narcotic drug classifications. Visit characteristics studied included sociodemographic variables, and ED clinical variables, such as chief complaint, and discharge diagnosis. Machine learning methods were used to determine predictors of ED-RX and DC-RX and weighted logistic regressions were performed using selected predictors., Results: Of the 44,227 ED visits identified, patients tended to be female (57.4%), and White (74.2%) with an average age of 46.4 years (SE = 0.3). Weighted proportions of ED-RX and DC-RX were 23.2% and 18.9%, respectively. The strongest predictors of ED-RX were CT scan ordered (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.84-2.58), abdominal pain (OR = 1.93, 95% CI:1.59-2.34) and back pain (OR = 1.81, 95% CI:1.45-2.27). Tooth pain (OR = 6.94, 95% CI = 4.40-10.94) and fracture injury diagnoses (OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 2.72-5.19) were the strongest predictors of DC-RX., Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the utility of machine learning for understanding clinical predictors of opioid administration and prescribing in the ED, and its potential in informing standardized prescribing recommendations and guidelines., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Triage is an essential emergency department (ED) process designed to provide timely management depending on acuity and severity; however, the process may be inconsistent with clinical and hospitalization outcomes. Therefore, studies have attempted to augment this process with machine learning models, showing advantages in predicting critical conditions and hospitalization outcomes. The aim of this study was to utilize nationwide registry data to develop a machine learning-based classification model to predict the clinical course of pediatric ED visits., METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study used data from the National Emergency Department Information System on emergency visits of children under 15 years of age from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. The primary and secondary outcomes were to identify critically ill children and predict hospitalization from triage data, respectively. We developed and tested a random forest model with the under sampled dataset and validated the model using the entire dataset. We compared the model's performance with that of the conventional triage system., RESULTS: A total of 2,621,710 children were eligible for the analysis and included 12,951 (0.5%) critical outcomes and 303,808 (11.6%) hospitalizations. After validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.991 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.991-0.992) for critical outcomes and 0.943 (95% CI 0.943-0.944) for hospitalization, which were higher than those of the conventional triage system., CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning-based model using structured triage data from a nationwide database can effectively predict critical illness and hospitalizations among children visiting the ED.

AB  - Identifying critically ill patients is a key challenge in emergency department (ED) triage. Mis-triage errors are still widespread in triage systems around the world. Here, we present a machine learning system (MLS) to assist ED triage officers better recognize critically ill patients and provide a text-based explanation of the MLS recommendation. To derive the MLS, an existing dataset of 22,272 patient encounters from 2012 to 2019 from our institution's electronic emergency triage system (EETS) was used for algorithm training and validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.875 +/- 0.006 (CI:95%) in retrospective dataset using fivefold cross validation, higher than that of reference model (0.843 +/- 0.005 (CI:95%)). In the prospective cohort study, compared to the traditional triage system's 1.2% mis-triage rate, the mis-triage rate in the MLS-assisted group was 0.9%. This MLS method with a real-time explanation for triage officers was able to lower the mis-triage rate of critically ill ED patients. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - Study objective: This study aimed to develop and validate 2 machine learning models that use historical and current-visit patient data from electronic health records to predict the probability of patient admission to either an inpatient unit or ICU at each hour (up to 24 hours) of an emergency department (ED) encounter. The secondary goal was to provide a framework for the operational implementation of these machine learning models., Methods: Data were curated from 468,167 adult patient encounters in 3 EDs (1 academic and 2 community-based EDs) of a large academic health system from August 1, 2015, to October 31, 2018. The models were validated using encounter data from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. An operational user dashboard was developed, and the models were run on real-time encounter data., Results: For the intermediate admission model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.873 and the area under the precision-recall curve was 0.636. For the ICU admission model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.951 and the area under the precision-recall curve was 0.461. The models had similar performance in both the academic- and community-based settings as well as across the 2019 and real-time encounter data., Conclusion: Machine learning models were developed to accurately make predictions regarding the probability of inpatient or ICU admission throughout the entire duration of a patient's encounter in ED and not just at the time of triage. These models remained accurate for a patient cohort beyond the time period of the initial training data and were integrated to run on live electronic health record data, with similar performance., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - Short-term reattendances to emergency departments are a key quality of care indicator. Identifying patients at increased risk of early reattendance could help reduce the number of missed critical illnesses and could reduce avoidable utilization of emergency departments by enabling targeted post-discharge intervention. In this manuscript, we present a retrospective, single-centre study where we created and evaluated an extreme gradient boosting decision tree model trained to identify patients at risk of reattendance within 72 h of discharge from an emergency department (University Hospitals Southampton Foundation Trust, UK). Our model was trained using 35,447 attendances by 28,945 patients and evaluated on a hold-out test set featuring 8847 attendances by 7237 patients. The set of attendances from a given patient appeared exclusively in either the training or the test set. Our model was trained using both visit level variables (e.g., vital signs, arrival mode, and chief complaint) and a set of variables available in a patients electronic patient record, such as age and any recorded medical conditions. On the hold-out test set, our highest performing model obtained an AUROC of 0.747 (95% CI 0.722-0.773) and an average precision of 0.233 (95% CI 0.194-0.277). These results demonstrate that machine-learning models can be used to classify patients, with moderate performance, into low and high-risk groups for reattendance. We explained our models predictions using SHAP values, a concept developed from coalitional game theory, capable of explaining predictions at an attendance level. We demonstrated how clustering techniques (the UMAP algorithm) can be used to investigate the different sub-groups of explanations present in our patient cohort. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate a logistic regression-based machine learning (ML) prognostic algorithm implemented in real-time as a clinical decision support (CDS) system for symptomatic persons under investigation (PUI) for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the emergency department (ED)., METHODS: We developed in a 12-hospital system a model using training and validation followed by a real-time assessment. The LASSO guided feature selection included demographics, comorbidities, home medications, vital signs. We constructed a logistic regression-based ML algorithm to predict "severe" COVID-19, defined as patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or died in or out-of-hospital. Training data included 1,469 adult patients who tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 14 days of acute care. We performed: 1) temporal validation in 414 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 2) validation in a PUI set of 13,271 patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 test during an acute care visit, and 3) real-time validation in 2,174 ED patients with PUI test or positive SARS-CoV-2 result. Subgroup analysis was conducted across race and gender to ensure equity in performance., RESULTS: The algorithm performed well on pre-implementation validations for predicting COVID-19 severity: 1) the temporal validation had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.87 (95%-CI: 0.83, 0.91); 2) validation in the PUI population had an AUROC of 0.82 (95%-CI: 0.81, 0.83). The ED CDS system performed well in real-time with an AUROC of 0.85 (95%-CI, 0.83, 0.87). Zero patients in the lowest quintile developed "severe" COVID-19. Patients in the highest quintile developed "severe" COVID-19 in 33.2% of cases. The models performed without significant differences between genders and among race/ethnicities (all p-values > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: A logistic regression model-based ML-enabled CDS can be developed, validated, and implemented with high performance across multiple hospitals while being equitable and maintaining performance in real-time validation.

AB  - The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI), 5th generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a "new normal", the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as recommendations on future directions., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - Study objective: Machine-learning algorithms allow improved prediction of sepsis syndromes in the emergency department (ED), using data from electronic medical records. Transfer learning, a new subfield of machine learning, allows generalizability of an algorithm across clinical sites. We aim to validate the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert for the prediction of delayed septic shock in a cohort of patients treated in the ED and demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning to improve external validity at a second site., Methods: This was an observational cohort study using data from greater than 180,000 patients from 2 academic medical centers between 2014 and 2019, using multiple definitions of sepsis. The Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm was trained with 40 input variables at the development site to predict delayed septic shock (occurring greater than 4 hours after ED triage) at various prediction windows. We then validated the algorithm at a second site, using transfer learning to demonstrate generalizability of the algorithm., Results: We identified 9,354 patients with severe sepsis, of whom 723 developed septic shock at least 4 hours after triage. The Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm demonstrated excellent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (>0.8) at 8 and 12 hours for the prediction of delayed septic shock. Transfer learning significantly improved the test characteristics of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm and yielded comparable performance at the validation site., Conclusion: The Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm accurately predicted the development of delayed septic shock. The use of transfer learning allowed significantly improved external validity and generalizability at a second site. Future prospective studies are indicated to evaluate the clinical utility of this model., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In emergency services is important to accurately assess and classify symptoms, which may be improved with the help of technology. One mechanism that could help and improve predictions from health records or patient flow is machine learning (ML)., AIM: To analyse the effectiveness of ML systems in triage for making predictions at the emergency department in comparison with other triage scales/scores., METHODS: Following the PRISMA recommendations, a systematic review was conducted using CINAHL, Cochrane, Cuiden, Medline and Scopus databases with the search equation "Machine learning AND triage AND emergency"., RESULTS: Eleven studies were identified. The studies show that the use of ML methods consistently predict important outcomes like mortality, critical care outcomes and admission, and the need for hospitalization in comparison with scales like Emergency Severity Index or others. Among the ML models considered, XGBoost and Deep Neural Networks obtained the highest levels of prediction accuracy, while Logistic Regression performed obtained the worst values., CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning methods can be a good instrument for helping triage process with the prediction of important emergency variables like mortality or the need for critical care or hospitalization.

AB  - Introduction: Triage is critical to mitigating the effect of increased volume by determining patient acuity, need for resources, and establishing acuity-based patient prioritization. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether historical EHR data can be used with clinical natural language processing and machine learning algorithms (KATE) to produce accurate ESI predictive models., Methods: The KATE triage model was developed using 166,175 patient encounters from two participating hospitals. The model was tested against a random sample of encounters that were correctly assigned an acuity by study clinicians using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) standard as a guide., Results: At the study sites, KATE predicted accurate ESI acuity assignments 75.7% of the time compared with nurses (59.8%) and the average of individual study clinicians (75.3%). KATE's accuracy was 26.9% higher than the average nurse accuracy (P <.001). On the boundary between ESI 2 and ESI 3 acuity assignments, which relates to the risk of decompensation, KATE's accuracy was 93.2% higher, with 80% accuracy compared with triage nurses 41.4% accuracy (P <.001)., Discussion: KATE provides a triage acuity assignment more accurate than the triage nurses in this study sample. KATE operates independently of contextual factors, unaffected by the external pressures that can cause under triage and may mitigate biases that can negatively affect triage accuracy. Future research should focus on the impact of KATE providing feedback to triage nurses in real time, on mortality and morbidity, ED throughput, resource optimization, and nursing outcomes., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - Timely assessment to accurately prioritize patients is crucial for emergency department (ED) management. Urgent (i.e., level-3, on a 5-level emergency severity index system) patients have become a challenge since under-triage and over-triage often occur. This study was aimed to develop a computational model by artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies to accurately predict urgent patient outcomes using data that are readily available in most ED triage systems. We retrospectively collected data from the ED of a tertiary teaching hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. Eleven variables were used for data analysis and prediction model building, including 1 response, 2 demographic, and 8 clinical variables. A model to predict hospital admission was developed using neural networks and machine learning methodologies. A total of 282,971 samples of urgent (level-3) visits were included in the analysis. Our model achieved a validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8004 (95% CI 0.7963-0.8045). The optimal cutoff value identified by Youden's index for determining hospital admission was 0.5517. Using this cutoff value, the sensitivity was 0.6721 (95% CI 0.6624-0.6818), and the specificity was 0.7814 (95% CI 0.7777-0.7851), with a positive predictive value of 0.3660 (95% CI 0.3586-0.3733) and a negative predictive value of 0.9270 (95% CI 0.9244-0.9295). Subgroup analysis revealed that this model performed better in the nontraumatic adult subgroup and achieved a validation AUC of 0.8166 (95% CI 0.8199-0.8212). Our AI model accurately assessed the need for hospitalization for urgent patients, which constituted nearly 70% of ED visits. This model demonstrates the potential for streamlining ED operations using a very limited number of variables that are readily available in most ED triage systems. Subgroup analysis is an important topic for future investigation. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - : Personalized medicine is among the most exciting innovations in recent clinical research, offering the opportunity for tailored screening and management at the individual level. Biomarker-enriched clinical trials have shown increased efficiency and informativeness in cancer research due to the selective exclusion of patients unlikely to benefit., In acute stress situations, clinically significant decisions are often made in time-sensitive manners and providers may be pressed to make decisions based on abbreviated clinical assessments. Up to 30% of trauma survivors admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) will develop long-lasting posttraumatic stress psychopathologies. The long-term impact of those survivors with posttraumatic stress sequelae are significant, impacting both long-term psychological and physiological recovery. An accurate prognostic model of who will develop posttraumatic stress symptoms does not exist yet. Additionally, no scalable and cost-effective method that can be easily integrated into routine care exists, even though especially the acute care setting provides a critical window of opportunity for prevention in the so-called golden hours when preventive measures are most effective. In this review, we aim to discuss emerging machine learning (ML) applications that are promising for precisely risk stratification and targeted treatments in the acute care setting., The aim of this narrative review is to present examples of digital health innovations and to discuss the potential of these new approaches for treatment selection and prevention of posttraumatic sequelae in the acute care setting. The application of artificial intelligence-based solutions have already had great success in other areas and are rapidly approaching the field of psychological care as well. New ways of algorithm-based risk predicting, and the use of digital phenotypes provide a high potential for predicting future risk of PTSD in acute care settings and to go new steps in precision psychiatry., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies reported that the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) has shown superiority over other screening tools in discriminating emergency department (ED) patients who are likely to progress to septic shock., OBJECTIVES: To improve the performance of the NEWS for septic shock prediction by adding variables collected during ED triage, and to implement a machine-learning algorithm., METHODS: The study population comprised adult ED patients with suspected infection. To detect septic shock within 24 h after ED arrival, the Sepsis-3 clinical criteria and nine variables were used: NEWS, age, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation. The model was developed using logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The evaluations were performed using an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and net reclassification index (NRI)., RESULTS: Overall, 41,687 patients were enrolled. The AUROC of the model with NEWS, age, gender, and the six vital signs (0.835-0.845) was better than that of the baseline model (0.804). The XGB model (AUROC 0.845) was the most accurate, compared with LR (0.844) and ANN (0.835). The LR and XGB models were well calibrated; however, the ANN showed poor calibration power. The LR and XGB models showed better reclassification than the baseline model with positive NRI., CONCLUSION: The discrimination power of the model for screening septic shock using NEWS, age, gender, and the six vital signs collected at ED triage outperformed the baseline NEWS model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the risk stratification of critically ill patient with chest pain is a challenge. We aimed to use machine learning approach to predict the critical care outcomes in patients with chest pain, and simultaneously compare its performance with HEART, GRACE, and TIMI scores., METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-control study in patients with acute non-traumatic chest pain who presented to the emergency department (ED) between January 2017 and December 2019. The outcomes included cardiac arrest, transfer to ICU, and death during treatment in ED. In the randomly sampled training set (70%), a LASSO regression model was developed, and presented with nomogram. The performance was measured in both training set (70% participants) and testing set (30% participants), and findings were compared with the three widely used scores., RESULTS: We proposed a LASSO regression model incorporating mode of arrival, reperfusion therapy, Killip class, systolic BP, serum creatinine, creatine kinase-MB, and brain natriuretic peptide as independent predictors of critical care outcomes in patients with chest pain. Our model significantly outperformed the HEART, GRACE, TIMI score with AUC of 0.953 (95%CI: 0.922-0.984), 0.754 (95%CI: 0.675-0.832), 0.747 (95%CI: 0.664-0.829), 0.735 (95%CI: 0.655-0.815), respectively. Consistently, our model demonstrated better outcomes regarding the metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score. Similarly, the decision curve analysis elucidated a greater net benefit of our model over the full ranges of clinical thresholds., CONCLUSION: We present an accurate model for predicting the critical care outcomes in patients with chest pain, and provide substantial support to its application as a decision-making tool in ED.

AB  - Study objective: We use variables from a recently derived acute heart failure risk-stratification rule (STRATIFY) as a basis to develop and optimize risk prediction using additional patient clinical data from electronic health records and machine-learning models., Methods: Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified all emergency department (ED) visits for acute heart failure between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, among adult health plan members of a large system with 21 EDs. The primary outcome was any 30-day serious adverse event, including death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, balloon-pump insertion, intubation, new dialysis, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. Starting with the 13 variables from the STRATIFY rule (base model), we tested whether predictive accuracy in a different population could be enhanced with additional electronic health record-based variables or machine-learning approaches (compared with logistic regression). We calculated our derived model area under the curve (AUC), calculated test characteristics, and assessed admission rates across risk categories., Results: Among 26,189 total ED encounters, mean patient age was 74 years, 51.7% were women, and 60.7% were white. The overall 30-day serious adverse event rate was 18.8%. The base model had an AUC of 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.77). Incorporating additional variables led to improved accuracy with logistic regression (AUC 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.82) and machine learning (AUC 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.86). We found that 11.1%, 25.7%, and 48.9% of the study population had predicted serious adverse event risk of less than or equal to 3%, less than or equal to 5%, and less than or equal to 10%, respectively, and 28% of those with less than or equal to 3% risk were admitted., Conclusion: Use of a machine-learning model with additional variables improved 30-day risk prediction compared with conventional approaches., (C) 2021Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - : Modern clinical practice requires the integration and interpretation of ever-expanding volumes of clinical data. There is, therefore, an imperative to develop efficient ways to process and understand these large amounts of data. Neurologists work to understand the function of biological neural networks, but artificial neural networks and other forms of machine learning algorithm are likely to be increasingly encountered in clinical practice. As their use increases, clinicians will need to understand the basic principles and common types of algorithm.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients undergoing outpatient radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) frequently require acute care (emergency department evaluation or hospitalization). Machine learning (ML) may guide interventions to reduce this risk. There are limited prospective studies investigating the clinical impact of ML in health care. The objective of this study was to determine whether ML can identify high-risk patients and direct mandatory twice-weekly clinical evaluation to reduce acute care visits during treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: During this single-institution randomized quality improvement study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04277650), 963 outpatient adult courses of RT and CRT started from January 7 to June 30, 2019, were evaluated by an ML algorithm. Among these, 311 courses identified by ML as high risk (> 10% risk of acute care during treatment) were randomized to standard once-weekly clinical evaluation (n = 157) or mandatory twice-weekly evaluation (n = 154). Both arms allowed additional evaluations on the basis of clinician discretion. The primary end point was the rate of acute care visits during RT. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and decile calibration plots., RESULTS: Twice-weekly evaluation reduced rates of acute care during treatment from 22.3% to 12.3% (difference, -10.0%; 95% CI, -18.3 to -1.6; relative risk, 0.556; 95% CI, 0.332 to 0.924; P = .02). Low-risk patients had a 2.7% acute care rate. Model discrimination was good in high- and low-risk patients undergoing standard once-weekly evaluation (AUC, 0.851)., CONCLUSION: In this prospective randomized study, ML accurately triaged patients undergoing RT and CRT, directing clinical management with reduced acute care rates versus standard of care. This prospective study demonstrates the potential benefit of ML in health care and offers opportunities to enhance care quality and reduce health care costs., (C) 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early identification of emergency department (ED) patients who need hospitalization is essential for quality of care and patient safety. We aimed to compare machine learning (ML) models predicting the hospitalization of ED patients and conventional regression techniques at three points in time after ED registration., METHODS: We analyzed consecutive ED patients of three hospitals using the Netherlands Emergency Department Evaluation Database (NEED). We developed prediction models for hospitalization using an increasing number of data available at triage, ~30 min (including vital signs) and ~2 h (including laboratory tests) after ED registration, using ML (random forest, gradient boosted decision trees, deep neural networks) and multivariable logistic regression analysis (including spline transformations for continuous predictors). Demographics, urgency, presenting complaints, disease severity and proxies for comorbidity, and complexity were used as covariates. We compared the performance using the area under the ROC curve in independent validation sets from each hospital., RESULTS: We included 172,104 ED patients of whom 66,782 (39 %) were hospitalized. The AUC of the multivariable logistic regression model was 0.82 (0.78-0.86) at triage, 0.84 (0.81-0.86) at ~30 min and 0.83 (0.75-0.92) after ~2 h. The best performing ML model over time was the gradient boosted decision trees model with an AUC of 0.84 (0.77-0.88) at triage, 0.86 (0.82-0.89) at ~30 min and 0.86 (0.74-0.93) after ~2 h., CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that machine learning models had an excellent but similar predictive performance as the logistic regression model for predicting hospital admission. In comparison to the 30-min model, the 2-h model did not show a performance improvement. After further validation, these prediction models could support management decisions by real-time feedback to medical personal. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been promisingly applied in many fields of clinical medicine, both for diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Aims of this narrative review were to summarize the basic concepts of ML applied to clinical medicine and explore its main applications in the emergency department (ED) setting, with a particular focus on syncope management. Through an extensive literature search in PubMed and Embase, we found increasing evidence suggesting that the use of ML algorithms can improve ED triage, diagnosis, and risk stratification of many diseases. However, the lacks of external validation and reliable diagnostic standards currently limit their implementation in clinical practice. Syncope represents a challenging problem for the emergency physician both because its diagnosis is not supported by specific tests and the available prognostic tools proved to be inefficient. ML algorithms have the potential to overcome these limitations and, in the future, they could support the clinician in managing syncope patients more efficiently. However, at present only few studies have addressed this issue, albeit with encouraging results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection and intervention are the key factors for improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this observational longitudinal study was to identify nonoverlapping severity subgroups (ie, clusters) among patients with COVID-19, based exclusively on clinical data and standard laboratory tests obtained during patient assessment in the emergency department., METHODS: We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols., RESULTS: From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests-the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils-were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3., CONCLUSIONS: A few standard laboratory tests, deemed available in all emergency departments, have shown good discriminative power for the characterization of severity subgroups among patients with COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with sepsis who present to an emergency department (ED) have highly variable underlying disease severity, and can be categorized from low to high risk. Development of a risk stratification tool for these patients is important for appropriate triage and early treatment. The aim of this study was to develop machine learning models predicting 31-day mortality in patients presenting to the ED with sepsis and to compare these to internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores., METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted amongst 1,344 emergency department patients fulfilling sepsis criteria. Laboratory and clinical data that was available in the first two hours of presentation from these patients were randomly partitioned into a development (n = 1,244) and validation dataset (n = 100). Machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the development dataset and compared to internal medicine physicians and risk scores in the independent validation dataset. The primary outcome was 31-day mortality., RESULTS: A number of 1,344 patients were included of whom 174 (13.0%) died. Machine learning models trained with laboratory or a combination of laboratory + clinical data achieved an area-under-the ROC curve of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80-0.84) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81-0.87) for predicting 31-day mortality, respectively. In the validation set, models outperformed internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores in sensitivity (92% vs. 72% vs. 78%;p<0.001,all comparisons) while retaining comparable specificity (78% vs. 74% vs. 72%;p>0.02). The model had higher diagnostic accuracy with an area-under-the-ROC curve of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.78-0.92) compared to abbMEDS (0.63,0.54-0.73), mREMS (0.63,0.54-0.72) and internal medicine physicians (0.74,0.65-0.82)., CONCLUSION: Machine learning models outperformed internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores in predicting 31-day mortality. These models are a promising tool to aid in risk stratification of patients presenting to the ED with sepsis.

AB  - Early admission to the neurosciences intensive care unit (NSICU) is associated with improved patient outcomes. Natural language processing offers new possibilities for mining free text in electronic health record data. We sought to develop a machine learning model using both tabular and free text data to identify patients requiring NSICU admission shortly after arrival to the emergency department (ED). We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients at the Mount Sinai Hospital, an academic medical center in New York City. All patients presenting to our institutional ED between January 2014 and December 2018 were included. Structured (tabular) demographic, clinical, bed movement record data, and free text data from triage notes were extracted from our institutional data warehouse. A machine learning model was trained to predict likelihood of NSICU admission at 30 min from arrival to the ED. We identified 412,858 patients presenting to the ED over the study period, of whom 1900 (0.5%) were admitted to the NSICU. The daily median number of ED presentations was 231 (IQR 200-256) and the median time from ED presentation to the decision for NSICU admission was 169 min (IQR 80-324). A model trained only with text data had an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-0.91). A structured data-only model had an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.91-0.94). A combined model trained on structured and text data had an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.95). At a false positive rate of 1:100 (99% specificity), the combined model was 58% sensitive for identifying NSICU admission. A machine learning model using structured and free text data can predict NSICU admission soon after ED arrival. This may potentially improve ED and NSICU resource allocation. Further studies should validate our findings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed is a common reason for hospitalization with 2%-10% risk of mortality. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to calculate the risk of mortality in intensive care unit patients admitted for GI bleed and compared it with APACHE IVa risk score. We used explainable ML methods to provide insight into the model's prediction and outcome., METHODS: We analyzed the patient data in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database and extracted data for 5,691 patients (mean age = 67.4 years; 61% men) admitted with GI bleed. The data were used in training a ML model to identify patients who died in the intensive care unit. We compared the predictive performance of the ML model with the APACHE IVa risk score. Performance was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. This study also used explainable ML methods to provide insights into the model's outcome or prediction using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method., RESULTS: The ML model performed better than the APACHE IVa risk score in correctly classifying the low-risk patients. The ML model had a specificity of 27% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25-36) at a sensitivity of 100% compared with the APACHE IVa score, which had a specificity of 4% (95% CI: 3-31) at a sensitivity of 100%. The model identified patients who died with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80-0.90) in the internal validation set, whereas the APACHE IVa clinical scoring systems identified patients who died with AUC values of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86) with P value <0.001., DISCUSSION: We developed a ML model that predicts the mortality in patients with GI bleed with a greater accuracy than the current scoring system. By making the ML model explainable, clinicians would be able to better understand the reasoning behind the outcome., (C) The American College of Gastroenterology 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Having shown promise in other medical fields, we sought to determine whether machine learning (ML) models perform better than usual care in diagnostic and prognostic prediction for emergency department (ED) patients., METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and CINAHL from inception to October 17, 2019. We included studies comparing diagnostic and prognostic prediction of ED patients by ML models to usual care methods (triage-based scores, clinical prediction tools, clinician judgment) using predictor variables readily available to ED clinicians. We extracted commonly reported performance metrics of model discrimination and classification. We used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020158129)., RESULTS: The search yielded 1,656 unique records, of which 23 studies involving 16,274,647 patients were included. In all seven diagnostic studies, ML models outperformed usual care in all performance metrics. In six studies assessing in-hospital mortality, the best-performing ML models had better discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] =0.74-0.94) than any clinical decision tool (AUROC =0.68-0.81). In four studies assessing hospitalization, ML models had better discrimination (AUROC =0.80-0.83) than triage-based scores (AUROC =0.68-0.82). Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Most studies had high risk of bias due to lack of external validation, low event rates, and insufficient reporting of calibration., CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that ML may have better prediction performance than usual care for ED patients with a variety of clinical presentations and outcomes. However, prediction model reporting guidelines should be followed to provide clinically applicable data. Interventional trials are needed to assess the impact of ML models on patient-centered outcomes. Copyright © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate differentiation and prioritization in emergency department (ED) triage is important to identify high-risk patients and to efficiently allocate of finite resources. Using data available from patients with suspected cardiovascular disease presenting at ED triage, this study aimed to train and compare the performance of four common machine learning models to assist in decision making of triage levels., METHODS: This cross-sectional study in the second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University was conducted from August 2015 to December 2018 inclusive. Demographic information, vital signs, blood glucose, and other available triage scores were collected. Four machine learning models - multinomial logistic regression (multinomial LR), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF) and gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) - were compared. For each model, 80 % of the data set was used for training and 20 % was used to test the models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy and macro- F1 were calculated for each model., RESULTS: In 17,661 patients presenting with suspected cardiovascular disease, the distribution of triage of level 1, level 2, level 3 and level 4 were 1.3 %, 18.6 %, 76.5 %, and 3.6 % respectively. The AUCs were: XGBoost (0.937), GBDT (0.921), RF (0.919) and multinomial LR (0.908). Based on feature importance generated by XGBoost, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and age were the most significant variables for making decisions at triage., CONCLUSION: Four machine learning models had good discriminative ability of triage. XGBoost demonstrated a slight advantage over other models. These models could be used for differential triage of low-risk patients and high-risk patients as a strategy to improve efficiency and allocation of finite resources. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Risk assessment tools for patients with gastrointestinal bleeding may be used for determining level of care and informing management decisions. Development of models that use data from electronic health records is an important step for future deployment of such tools in clinical practice. Furthermore, machine learning tools have the potential to outperform standard clinical risk assessment tools. The authors developed a new machine learning tool for the outcome of in-hospital mortality and suggested it outperforms the intensive care unit prognostic tool, APACHE IVa. Limitations include lack of generalizability beyond intensive care unit patients, inability to use early in the hospital course, and lack of external validation., (C) The American College of Gastroenterology 2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In emergency medical services (EMSs), accurately predicting the severity of a patient's medical condition is important for the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk. In this study, we developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on deep learning to predict the need for critical care during EMS., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observation cohort study. The algorithm was established using development data from the Korean national emergency department information system, which were collected during visits in real time from 151 emergency departments (EDs). We validated the algorithm using EMS run sheets from two EDs. The study subjects comprised adult patients who visited EDs. The endpoint was critical care, and we used age, sex, chief complaint, symptom onset to arrival time, trauma, and initial vital signs as the predicted variables., RESULTS: The number of patients in the development data was 8,981,181, and the validation data comprised 2604 EMS run sheets from two hospitals. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the algorithm to predict the critical care was 0.867 (95% confidence interval, [0.864-0.871]). This result outperformed the Emergency Severity Index (0.839 [0.831-0.846]), Korean Triage and Acuity System (0.824 [0.815-0.832]), National Early Warning Score (0.741 [0.734-0.748]), and Modified Early Warning Score (0.696 [0.691-0.699])., CONCLUSIONS: The AI algorithm accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients using information during EMS and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores.

AB  - The past 5 years have seen an explosion of interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques in medicine. This has been driven by the development of deep neural networks (DNNs)-complex networks residing in silico but loosely modelled on the human brain-that can process complex input data such as a chest radiograph image and output a classification such as 'normal' or 'abnormal'. DNNs are 'trained' using large banks of images or other input data that have been assigned the correct labels. DNNs have shown the potential to equal or even surpass the accuracy of human experts in pattern recognition tasks such as interpreting medical images or biosignals. Within respiratory medicine, the main applications of AI and machine learning thus far have been the interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung pathology slides and physiological data such as pulmonary function tests. This article surveys progress in this area over the past 5 years, as well as highlighting the current limitations of AI and machine learning and the potential for future developments., (C) 2020 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd & British Thoracic Society

AB  - : COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented healthcare crisis with millions of infected people across the globe often pushing infrastructures, healthcare workers and entire economies beyond their limits. The scarcity of testing kits, even in developed countries, has led to extensive research efforts towards alternative solutions with high sensitivity. Chest radiological imaging paired with artificial intelligence (AI) can offer significant advantages in diagnosis of novel coronavirus infected patients. To this end, transfer learning techniques are used for overcoming the limitations emanating from the lack of relevant big datasets, enabling specialized models to converge on limited data, as in the case of X-rays of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we present an interpretable AI framework assessed by expert radiologists on the basis on how well the attention maps focus on the diagnostically-relevant image regions. The proposed transfer learning methodology achieves an overall area under the curve of 1 for a binary classification problem across a 5-fold training/testing dataset., (C)  Spandidos Publications 2020.

AB  - The risk stratification of patients in the emergency department begins at triage. It is vital to stratify patients early based on their severity, since undertriage can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Our aim was to present a new approach to assist healthcare professionals at triage in the stratification of patients and in identifying those with higher risk of ICU admission. Adult patients assigned Manchester Triage System (MTS) or Emergency Severity Index (ESI) 1 to 3 from a Portuguese and a United States Emergency Departments were analyzed. Variables routinely collected at triage were used and natural language processing was applied to the patient chief complaint. Stratified random sampling was applied to split the data in train (70%) and test (30%) sets and 10-fold cross validation was performed for model training. Logistic regression, random forests, and a random undersampling boosting algorithm were used. We compared the performance obtained with the reference model-using only triage priorities-with the models using additional variables. For both hospitals, a logistic regression model achieved higher overall performance, yielding areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.27-0.33) for the United States hospital and of 0.85 (95% CI 0.83-0.86) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.05-0.07) for the Portuguese hospital. Heart rate, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure were the most important predictors of ICU admission. Compared to the reference models, the models using clinical variables and the chief complaint presented higher recall for patients assigned MTS/ESI 3 and can identify patients assigned MTS/ESI 3 who are at risk for ICU admission.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a nontechnical, popular term that refers to machine learning of various types but most often to deep neural networks. Cardiology is at the forefront of AI in medicine. For this review, we searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases with no date restriction using search terms related to AI and cardiology. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of relevance. We highlight the major achievements in recent years in nearly all areas of cardiology and underscore the mounting evidence suggesting how AI will take center stage in the field. Artificial intelligence requires a close collaboration among computer scientists, clinical investigators, clinicians, and other users in order to identify the most relevant problems to be solved. Best practices in the generation and implementation of AI include the selection of ideal data sources, taking into account common challenges during the interpretation, validation, and generalizability of findings, and addressing safety and ethical concerns before final implementation. The future of AI in cardiology and in medicine in general is bright as the collaboration between investigators and clinicians continues to excel., (C) 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergency departments (ED) are becoming increasingly overwhelmed, increasing poor outcomes. Triage scores aim to optimize the waiting time and prioritize the resource usage. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms offer advantages for creating predictive clinical applications., OBJECTIVE: Evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning model for predicting mortality at the triage level and, by validating this automatic tool, improve the categorization of patients in the ED., DESIGN: An institutional review board (IRB) approval was granted for this retrospective study. Information of consecutive adult patients (ages 18-100) admitted at the emergency department (ED) of one hospital were retrieved (January 1, 2012-December 31, 2018). Features included the following: demographics, admission date, arrival mode, referral code, chief complaint, previous ED visits, previous hospitalizations, comorbidities, home medications, vital signs, and Emergency Severity Index (ESI). The following outcomes were evaluated: early mortality (up to 2 days post ED registration) and short-term mortality (2-30 days post ED registration). A gradient boosting model was trained on data from years 2012-2017 and examined on data from the final year (2018). The area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was used as an outcome metric. Single-variable analysis was conducted to develop a nine-point triage score for early mortality., KEY RESULTS: Overall, 799,522 ED visits were available for analysis. The early and short-term mortality rates were 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Models trained on the full set of features yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality and 0.923 for short-term mortality. A model that utilized the nine features with the highest single-variable AUC scores (age, arrival mode, chief complaint, five primary vital signs, and ESI) yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality., CONCLUSION: The gradient boosting model shows high predictive ability for screening patients at risk of early mortality utilizing data available at the time of triage in the ED.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Nephrolithiasis is a chronic disease and stone recurrence rates can be reduced by implementing the AUA kidney stone medical management guidelines. It is recommended that clinicians should perform additional metabolic testing in high-risk or interested first-time stone formers and recurrent stone formers. This investigation assessed the ability of artificial intelligence to identify patients who are at high risk for symptomatic kidney stone recurrence and predict when a patient will recur., METHODS: A 10 year period (January 2008 to December 2018) retrospective review of electronic medical records of patients with diagnosis of kidney stones. We used machine learning and developed two models to identify symptomatic stone recurrence: 1. Which patients are at risk of symptomatic recurrence 2. When will these patients present with a symptomatic recurrence. Symptomatic stone recurrence was defined as any kidney stone encounter occurring more than 90 days after initial diagnosis that involved an Emergency Department visit, admission, or surgery. The algorithm was developed on patients with kidney stone diagnosis encounters. The algorithm was validated on members with kidney stones between January 2019 to June 2019., RESULTS: A total of 108,000 patients were identified with the diagnosis of kidney stones. The algorithm was applied to 516,000 kidney stone encounters attributed to this cohort. The algorithm was validated on 1,123 patients with kidney stones between January 2019 to June 2019. The models consider 655 attributes that were identified through data analysis and clinician input. The models can predict which patients are at risk for symptomatic kidney stone recurrence with AUCROC = 0.83 (see  Figure 1). The time to recurrence model prioritized patients within the high risk group. C-statistic value is 0.79., CONCLUSIONS: Artificial Intelligence can analyze large and complex data sets and improve clinicians ability to triage patients into low, moderate and high-risk groups. This will improve patient counseling and may improve quality of care by implementing preventive measures on high risk patients and reduce metabolic workup, invasive endoscopy and ionizing radiation exposure for low risk kidney stone patients., (C) 2020 by the American Urological Association, Inc.

AB  - Background: We hypothesized utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms for screening septic shock in ED would provide better accuracy than qSOFA or MEWS., Methods: The study population was adult (>=20 years) patients visiting ED for suspected infection. Target event was septic shock within 24 h after arrival. Demographics, vital signs, level of consciousness, chief complaints (CC) and initial blood test results were used as predictors. CC were embedded into 16-dimensional vector space using singular value decomposition. Six base learners including support vector machine, gradient-boosting machine, random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and ridge regression and their ensembles were tested. We also trained and tested MLP networks with various setting., Results: A total of 49,560 patients were included and 4817 (9.7%) had septic shock within 24 h. All ML classifiers significantly outperformed qSOFA score, MEWS and their age-sex adjusted versions with their AUROC ranging from 0.883 to 0.929. The ensembles of the base classifiers showed the best performance and addition of CC embedding was associated with statistically significant increases in performance., Conclusions: ML classifiers significantly outperforms clinical scores in screening septic shock at ED triage., (C) 2020Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Development of emergency department (ED) triage systems that accurately differentiate and prioritize critically ill from stable patients remains challenging. We used machine learning models to predict clinical outcomes, and then compared their performance with that of a conventional approach-the Emergency Severity Index (ESI)., METHODS: Using National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) ED data, from 2007 through 2015, we identified all adult patients (aged >= 18 years). In the randomly sampled training set (70%), using routinely available triage data as predictors (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, chief complaints, comorbidities), we developed four machine learning models: Lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. As the reference model, we constructed a logistic regression model using the five-level ESI data. The clinical outcomes were critical care (admission to intensive care unit or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the test set (the remaining 30%), we measured the predictive performance, including area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and net benefit (decision curves) for each model., RESULTS: Of 135,470 eligible ED visits, 2.1% had critical care outcome and 16.2% had hospitalization outcome. In the critical care outcome prediction, all four machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.86 [95%CI 0.85-0.87] in the deep neural network vs 0.74 [95%CI 0.72-0.75] in the reference model), with less under-triaged patients in ESI triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to non-urgent). Likewise, in the hospitalization outcome prediction, all machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.82 [95%CI 0.82-0.83] in the deep neural network vs 0.69 [95%CI 0.68-0.69] in the reference model) with less over-triages in ESI triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). In the decision curve analysis, all machine learning models consistently achieved a greater net benefit-a larger number of appropriate triages considering a trade-off with over-triages-across the range of clinical thresholds., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the conventional approach, the machine learning models demonstrated a superior performance to predict critical care and hospitalization outcomes. The application of modern machine learning models may enhance clinicians' triage decision making, thereby achieving better clinical care and optimal resource utilization.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pediatric asthma is a leading cause of emergency department (ED) utilization and hospitalization. Earlier identification of need for hospital-level care could triage patients more efficiently to high- or low-resource ED tracks. Existing tools to predict disposition for pediatric asthma use only clinical data, perform best several hours into the ED stay, and are static or score-based. Machine learning offers a population-specific, dynamic option that allows real-time integration of available nonclinical data at triage. Our objective was to compare the performance of four common machine learning approaches, incorporating clinical data available at the time of triage with information about weather, neighborhood characteristics, and community viral load for early prediction of the need for hospital-level care in pediatric asthma., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients ages 2 to 18 years seen at two urban pediatric EDs with asthma exacerbation over 4 years. Asthma exacerbation was defined as receiving both albuterol and systemic corticosteroids. We included patient features, measures of illness severity available in triage, weather features, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza patterns. We tested four models: decision trees, LASSO logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. For each model, 80% of the data set was used for training and 20% was used to validate the models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve was calculated for each model., RESULTS: There were 29,392 patients included in the analyses: mean (+/-SD) age of 7.0 (+/-4.2) years, 42% female, 77% non-Hispanic black, and 76% public insurance. The AUCs for each model were: decision tree 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66-0.77), logistic regression 0.83 (95% CI = 0.82-0.83), random forests 0.82 (95% CI = 0.81-0.83), and gradient boosting machines 0.84 (95% CI = 0.83-0.85). In the lowest decile of risk, only 3% of patients required hospitalization; in the highest decile this rate was 100%. After patient vital signs and acuity, age and weight, followed by socioeconomic status (SES) and weather-related features, were the most important for predicting hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: Three of the four machine learning models performed well with decision trees preforming the worst. The gradient boosting machines model demonstrated a slight advantage over other approaches at predicting need for hospital-level care at the time of triage in pediatric patients presenting with asthma exacerbation. The addition of weight, SES, and weather data improved the performance of this model. Copyright © 2018 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

AB  - Objectives: To deploy machine learning tools (random forests) to develop a model that reliably predicts hospital mortality in children with acute infections residing in low- and middle-income countries, using age and other variables collected at hospital admission., Design: Post hoc analysis of a single-center, prospective, before-and-after feasibility trial., Setting: Rural district hospital in Rwanda, a low-income country in Sub-Sahara Africa., Patients: Infants and children greater than 28 days and less than 18 years of life hospitalized because of an acute infection., Interventions: None., Measurements and Main Results: Age, vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) capillary refill time, altered mental state collected at hospital admission, as well as survival status at hospital discharge were extracted from the trial database. This information was collected for 1,579 adult and pediatric patients admitted to a regional referral hospital with an acute infection in rural Rwanda. Nine-hundred forty-nine children were included in this analysis. We predicted survival in study subjects using random forests, a machine learning algorithm. Five prediction models, all including age plus two to five other variables, were tested. Three distinct optimization criteria of the algorithm were then compared. The in-hospital mortality was 1.5% (n = 14). All five models could predict in-hospital mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging between 0.69 and 0.8. The model including age, respiratory rate, capillary refill time, altered mental state exhibited the highest predictive value area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.8 (95% CI, 0.78-0.8) with the lowest possible number of variables., Conclusions: A machine learning-based algorithm could reliably predict hospital mortality in a Sub-Sahara African population of 949 children with an acute infection using easily collected information at admission which includes age, respiratory rate, capillary refill time, and altered mental state. Future studies need to evaluate and strengthen this algorithm in larger pediatric populations, both in high- and low-/middle-income countries., (C)2019The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the incremental benefit of using free text data in addition to vital sign and demographic data to identify patients with suspected infection in the emergency department., METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study performed at a tertiary academic teaching hospital. All consecutive ED patient visits between 12/17/08 and 2/17/13 were included. No patients were excluded. The primary outcome measure was infection diagnosed in the emergency department defined as a patient having an infection related ED ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis. Patients were randomly allocated to train (64%), validate (20%), and test (16%) data sets. After preprocessing the free text using bigram and negation detection, we built four models to predict infection, incrementally adding vital signs, chief complaint, and free text nursing assessment. We used two different methods to represent free text: a bag of words model and a topic model. We then used a support vector machine to build the prediction model. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the discriminatory power of each model., RESULTS: A total of 230,936 patient visits were included in the study. Approximately 14% of patients had the primary outcome of diagnosed infection. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the vitals model, which used only vital signs and demographic data, was 0.67 for the training data set, 0.67 for the validation data set, and 0.67 (95% CI 0.65-0.69) for the test data set. The AUC for the chief complaint model which also included demographic and vital sign data was 0.84 for the training data set, 0.83 for the validation data set, and 0.83 (95% CI 0.81-0.84) for the test data set. The best performing methods made use of all of the free text. In particular, the AUC for the bag-of-words model was 0.89 for training data set, 0.86 for the validation data set, and 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87) for the test data set. The AUC for the topic model was 0.86 for the training data set, 0.86 for the validation data set, and 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.86) for the test data set., CONCLUSION: Compared to previous work that only used structured data such as vital signs and demographic information, utilizing free text drastically improves the discriminatory ability (increase in AUC from 0.67 to 0.86) of identifying infection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A key aim of triage is to identify those with high risk of cardiac arrest, as they require intensive monitoring, resuscitation facilities, and early intervention. We aim to validate a novel machine learning (ML) score incorporating heart rate variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS)., METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients (Patient Acuity Category Scale 1 and 2) in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5-minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death., RESULTS: From June 2006 to June 2008 we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781, compared with 0.680 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.101, 95% confidence interval: 0.006 to 0.197). As for in-hospital death, the area under the curve for ML score is 0.741, compared with 0.693 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.048, 95% confidence interval: -0.023 to 0.119). A cutoff ML score >= 60 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 84.1%, specificity of 72.3% and negative predictive value of 98.8%. A cutoff MEWS >= 3 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 74.4%, specificity of 54.2% and negative predictive value of 97.8%., CONCLUSION: We found ML scores to be more accurate than the MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours. There is potential to develop bedside devices for risk stratification based on cardiac arrest prediction.

AB  - Background: Variations in cardiac troponin concentrations by age, sex, and time between samples in patients with suspected myocardial infarction are not currently accounted for in diagnostic approaches. We aimed to combine these variables through machine learning to improve the assessment of risk for individual patients., Methods: A machine learning algorithm (myocardial-ischemic-injury-index [MI3]) incorporating age, sex, and paired high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations, was trained on 3013 patients and tested on 7998 patients with suspected myocardial infarction. MI3 uses gradient boosting to compute a value (0-100) reflecting an individual's likelihood of a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction and estimates the sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity and positive predictive value for that individual. Assessment was by calibration and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Secondary analysis evaluated example MI3 thresholds from the training set that identified patients as low risk (99% sensitivity) and high risk (75% positive predictive value), and performance at these thresholds was compared in the test set to the 99th percentile and European Society of Cardiology rule-out pathways., Results: Myocardial infarction occurred in 404 (13.4%) patients in the training set and 849 (10.6%) patients in the test set. MI3 was well calibrated with a very high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.963 [0.956-0.971] in the test set and similar performance in early and late presenters. Example MI3 thresholds identifying low- and high-risk patients in the training set were 1.6 and 49.7, respectively. In the test set, MI3 values were <1.6 in 69.5% with a negative predictive value of 99.7% (99.5-99.8%) and sensitivity of 97.8% (96.7-98.7%), and were >=49.7 in 10.6% with a positive predictive value of 71.8% (68.9-75.0%) and specificity of 96.7% (96.3-97.1%). Using these thresholds, MI3 performed better than the European Society of Cardiology 0/3-hour pathway (sensitivity, 82.5% [74.5-88.8%]; specificity, 92.2% [90.7-93.5%]) and the 99th percentile at any time point (sensitivity, 89.6% [87.4-91.6%]); specificity, 89.3% [88.6-90.0%])., Conclusions: Using machine learning, MI3 provides an individualized and objective assessment of the likelihood of myocardial infarction, which can be used to identify low- and high-risk patients who may benefit from earlier clinical decisions., Clinical Trial Registration: URL:  https://www.anzctr.org.au.

AB  - : Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is the future that is already here. Despite its potential as a transformational force for primary care, most primary care providers (PCPs) do not know what it is, how it will impact them and their patients, and what its key limitations and ethical pitfalls are. This article is a beginner's guide to health care AI, written for the frontline PCP. Primary care-as the dominant force at the base of the health care pyramid, with its unrivaled interconnectedness to every part of the health system and its deep relationship with patients and communities-is the most uniquely suited specialty to lead the health care AI revolution. PCPs can advance health care AI by partnering with technologists to ensure that AI use cases are relevant and human-centered, applying quality improvement methods to health care AI implementations, and advocating for inclusive and ethical AI that combats, rather than worsens, health inequities., Copyright (C) 2022 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

AB  - In an overcrowded emergency department (ED), trauma surgeons and emergency physicians need an accurate prognostic predictor for critical decision-making involving patients with severe trauma. We aimed to develope a machine learning-based early prognostic model based on admission features and initial ED management., We only recruited patients with severe trauma (defined as an injury severity score >15) as the study cohort and excluded children (defined as patients <16 years old) from a 4-years database (Chi-Mei Medical Center, from January 2015, to December 2018) recording the clinical features of all admitted trauma patients. We considered only patient features that could be determined within the first 2 hours after arrival to the ED. These variables included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score; heart rate; respiratory rate; mean arterial pressure (MAP); prehospital cardiac arrest; abbreviated injury scales (AIS) of head and neck, thorax, and abdomen; and ED interventions (tracheal intubation/tracheostomy, blood product transfusion, thoracostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation). The endpoint for prognostic analyses was mortality within 7 days of admission., We divided the study cohort into the early death group (149 patients who died within 7 days of admission) and non-early death group (2083 patients who survived at >7 days of admission). The extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model provided mortality prediction with higher accuracy (94.0%), higher sensitivity (98.0%), moderate specificity (54.8%), higher positive predict value (PPV) (95.4%), and moderate negative predictive value (NPV) (74.2%)., We developed a machine learning-based prognostic model that showed high accuracy, high sensitivity, and high PPV for predicting the mortality of patients with severe trauma., Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients undergoing outpatient radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) frequently require acute care (emergency department evaluation or hospitalization). Machine learning (ML) may guide interventions to reduce this risk. There are limited prospective studies investigating the clinical impact of ML in health care. The objective of this study was to determine whether ML can identify high-risk patients and direct mandatory twice-weekly clinical evaluation to reduce acute care visits during treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: During this single-institution randomized quality improvement study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04277650), 963 outpatient adult courses of RT and CRT started from January 7 to June 30, 2019, were evaluated by an ML algorithm. Among these, 311 courses identified by ML as high risk (> 10% risk of acute care during treatment) were randomized to standard once-weekly clinical evaluation (n = 157) or mandatory twice-weekly evaluation (n = 154). Both arms allowed additional evaluations on the basis of clinician discretion. The primary end point was the rate of acute care visits during RT. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and decile calibration plots., RESULTS: Twice-weekly evaluation reduced rates of acute care during treatment from 22.3% to 12.3% (difference, -10.0%; 95% CI, -18.3 to -1.6; relative risk, 0.556; 95% CI, 0.332 to 0.924; P = .02). Low-risk patients had a 2.7% acute care rate. Model discrimination was good in high- and low-risk patients undergoing standard once-weekly evaluation (AUC, 0.851)., CONCLUSION: In this prospective randomized study, ML accurately triaged patients undergoing RT and CRT, directing clinical management with reduced acute care rates versus standard of care. This prospective study demonstrates the potential benefit of ML in health care and offers opportunities to enhance care quality and reduce health care costs., (C) 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - Background: Acute exacerbation of COPD is one of the commonest reasons for emergency department (ED) attendance and admission. Optimising ED patient flow requires early identification of patients needing inpatient care to initiate the admissions process, improve bed management and reduce ED length of stay. Stratifying COPD patients by likelihood of admission and length of stay at triage would potentially facilitate these and other operational efficiencies, such as targeting early supported discharge team review and COPD care bundle. We propose a machine learning (ML) based approach to predicting the need for admission from ED amongst a cohort of COPD patients., Methods: Retrospective cohort study utilising electronic health record (EHR) data from 13,173 ED encounters in 1,763 COPD patients who attended ED in our healthboard with diagnosis of COPD from April 1 st 2013 - March 31 st 2017. Utilising only variables obtained at patient registration or already in the EHR from prior visits, we developed predictive models using ML algorithms, specifically ensemble-based methods XGBoost and AdaBoost, to predict a patient's likelihood of admission during that ED encounter. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for model validation., Results: The overall admission rate was 68% (8,869 of 13 173 encounters). The AdaBoost model showed superior performance in the derivation of a COPD ED admission risk score, with precision (positive predictive value) of 0.83, recall (sensitivity) of 0.79, accuracy of 0.75, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79. Precision, recall and negative predictive value improved with year of ED presentation, as data availability increased. The most significant features in the model included those related to prior utilisation of acute care services (both ED and inpatient)., Conclusions: The use of ensemble ML algorithms to predict ED admissions utilising variables available at patient triage showed good performance. Such results highlight the ability of applied ML in the healthcare setting when incomplete and disordered data is expected. Adding prospective data is likely to further improve model accuracy. Surfacing actionable insights and decision support from ML-derived predictive models to clinicians in real-time, at point of care, offers prospects for optimising COPD management., (C) 2018 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd & British Thoracic Society

AB  - Background: Variations in cardiac troponin concentrations by age, sex, and time between samples in patients with suspected myocardial infarction are not currently accounted for in diagnostic approaches. We aimed to combine these variables through machine learning to improve the assessment of risk for individual patients., Methods: A machine learning algorithm (myocardial-ischemic-injury-index [MI3]) incorporating age, sex, and paired high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations, was trained on 3013 patients and tested on 7998 patients with suspected myocardial infarction. MI3 uses gradient boosting to compute a value (0-100) reflecting an individual's likelihood of a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction and estimates the sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity and positive predictive value for that individual. Assessment was by calibration and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Secondary analysis evaluated example MI3 thresholds from the training set that identified patients as low risk (99% sensitivity) and high risk (75% positive predictive value), and performance at these thresholds was compared in the test set to the 99th percentile and European Society of Cardiology rule-out pathways., Results: Myocardial infarction occurred in 404 (13.4%) patients in the training set and 849 (10.6%) patients in the test set. MI3 was well calibrated with a very high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.963 [0.956-0.971] in the test set and similar performance in early and late presenters. Example MI3 thresholds identifying low- and high-risk patients in the training set were 1.6 and 49.7, respectively. In the test set, MI3 values were <1.6 in 69.5% with a negative predictive value of 99.7% (99.5-99.8%) and sensitivity of 97.8% (96.7-98.7%), and were >=49.7 in 10.6% with a positive predictive value of 71.8% (68.9-75.0%) and specificity of 96.7% (96.3-97.1%). Using these thresholds, MI3 performed better than the European Society of Cardiology 0/3-hour pathway (sensitivity, 82.5% [74.5-88.8%]; specificity, 92.2% [90.7-93.5%]) and the 99th percentile at any time point (sensitivity, 89.6% [87.4-91.6%]); specificity, 89.3% [88.6-90.0%])., Conclusions: Using machine learning, MI3 provides an individualized and objective assessment of the likelihood of myocardial infarction, which can be used to identify low- and high-risk patients who may benefit from earlier clinical decisions., Clinical Trial Registration: URL:  https://www.anzctr.org.au.

AB  - Early identification of high-risk septic patients in the emergency department (ED) may guide appropriate management and disposition, thereby improving outcomes. We compared the performance of machine learning models against conventional risk stratification tools, namely the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and our previously described Singapore ED Sepsis (SEDS) model, in the prediction of 30-day in-hospital mortality (IHM) among suspected sepsis patients in the ED., Adult patients who presented to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) ED between September 2014 and April 2016, and who met >=2 of the 4 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria were included. Patient demographics, vital signs and heart rate variability (HRV) measures obtained at triage were used as predictors. Baseline models were created using qSOFA, NEWS, MEWS, and SEDS scores. Candidate models were trained using k-nearest neighbors, random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting and support vector machine. Models were evaluated on F1 score and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC)., A total of 214 patients were included, of whom 40 (18.7%) met the outcome. Gradient boosting was the best model with a F1 score of 0.50 and AUPRC of 0.35, and performed better than all the baseline comparators (SEDS, F1 0.40, AUPRC 0.22; qSOFA, F1 0.32, AUPRC 0.21; NEWS, F1 0.38, AUPRC 0.28; MEWS, F1 0.30, AUPRC 0.25)., A machine learning model can be used to improve prediction of 30-day IHM among suspected sepsis patients in the ED compared to traditional risk stratification tools., Copyright (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Artificial intelligence offers the potential for transformational advancement in cardiovascular care delivery, yet practical applications of this technology have yet to be embedded in clinical workflows and systems. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms and accessibility to big data sources have created the ability for software to solve highly specialized problems outside of health care, such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and game playing (chess and Go), at superhuman efficiency previously not thought possible. To date, high-order cognitive problems in cardiovascular research such as differential diagnosis, treatment options, and clinical risk stratification have been difficult to address at scale with artificial intelligence. The practical application of artificial intelligence in the underlying operational processes in the delivery of cardiac care may be more amenable where adoption has great potential to fundamentally transform care delivery while maintaining the core quality and service that our patients demand. In this article, we provide an overview on how these artificial intelligence platforms can be implemented to improve the operational delivery of care for patients with cardiovascular disease., (C) 2018  by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - To date, there are no reviews on machine learning (ML) for predicting outcomes in trauma. Consequently, it remains unclear as to how ML-based prediction models compare in the triage and assessment of trauma patients. The objective of this review was to survey and identify studies involving ML for predicting outcomes in trauma, with the hypothesis that models predicting similar outcomes may share common features but the performance of ML in these studies will differ greatly. MEDLINE and other databases were searched for studies involving trauma and ML. Sixty-five observational studies involving ML for the prediction of trauma outcomes met inclusion criteria. In total 2,433,180 patients were included in the studies. The studies focused on prediction of the following outcome measures: survival/mortality (n = 34), morbidity/shock/hemorrhage (n = 12), hospital length of stay (n = 7), hospital admission/triage (n = 6), traumatic brain injury (n = 4), life-saving interventions (n = 5), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 4), and transfusion (n = 1). Six studies were prospective observational studies. Of the 65 studies, 33 used artificial neural networks for prediction. Importantly, most studies demonstrated the benefits of ML models. However, algorithm performance was assessed differently by different authors. Sensitivity-specificity gap values varied greatly from 0.035 to 0.927. Notably, studies shared many features for model development. A common ML feature base may be determined for predicting outcomes in trauma. However, the impact of ML will require further validation in prospective observational studies and randomized clinical trials, establishment of common performance criteria, and high-quality evidence about clinical and economic impacts before ML can be widely accepted in practice., (C) 2017 by the Shock Society

AB  - Study objective: Standards for emergency department (ED) triage in the United States rely heavily on subjective assessment and are limited in their ability to risk-stratify patients. This study seeks to evaluate an electronic triage system (e-triage) based on machine learning that predicts likelihood of acute outcomes enabling improved patient differentiation., Methods: A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study of 172,726 ED visits from urban and community EDs was conducted. E-triage is composed of a random forest model applied to triage data (vital signs, chief complaint, and active medical history) that predicts the need for critical care, an emergency procedure, and inpatient hospitalization in parallel and translates risk to triage level designations. Predicted outcomes and secondary outcomes of elevated troponin and lactate levels were evaluated and compared with the Emergency Severity Index (ESI)., Results: E-triage predictions had an area under the curve ranging from 0.73 to 0.92 and demonstrated equivalent or improved identification of clinical patient outcomes compared with ESI at both EDs. E-triage provided rationale for risk-based differentiation of the more than 65% of ED visits triaged to ESI level 3. Matching the ESI patient distribution for comparisons, e-triage identified more than 10% (14,326 patients) of ESI level 3 patients requiring up triage who had substantially increased risk of critical care or emergency procedure (1.7% ESI level 3 versus 6.2% up triaged) and hospitalization (18.9% versus 45.4%) across EDs., Conclusion: E-triage more accurately classifies ESI level 3 patients and highlights opportunities to use predictive analytics to support triage decisionmaking. Further prospective validation is needed., (C) 2018Elsevier, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The identification of stroke-associated biomarkers represents a means by which prehospital triage could be expedited to increase the probability of successful intervention. Thus, the objective of this work was to use high-throughput transcriptomics in combination with basic machine learning techniques to identify a pattern of gene expression in peripheral whole blood which could be used to identify acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the acute care setting., Methods: A two-stage study design was used which included a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort. In the discovery cohort, peripheral whole blood samples were obtained from 39 AIS patients upon emergency department admission, and from 24 neurologically asymptomatic controls. Microarray was used to measure the expression of over 22,000 genes and a pattern recognition technique known as genetic algorithm k-nearest neighbors (GA/kNN) identified a pattern of gene expression that optimally discriminated between AIS and controls. In an independent validation cohort, the gene expression pattern was tested for its ability to discriminate between 39 AIS patients and each of two different control groups, one consisting of 30 neurologically asymptomatic controls, and the other consisting of 15 stroke mimics, with gene expression levels being assessed by qRT-PCR., Results: In the discovery cohort, GA/kNN identified ten transcripts (ANTXR2, STK3, PDK4, CD163, MAL, GRAP, ID3, CTSZ, KIF1B, and PLXDC2) whose coordinate pattern of expression correctly identified 98.4% of subjects (97.4% sensitive, 100% specific). In the validation cohort, the same 10 transcripts correctly identified 95.6% of subjects when comparing AIS patients to asymptomatic controls (92.3% sensitive, 100% specific), and 96.3% of subjects when comparing AIS patients to stroke mimics (97.4% specific, 93.3% sensitive)., Conclusion: These results demonstrate that a highly accurate RNA-based companion diagnostic for AIS is plausible using a relatively small number of markers. The pattern of gene expression identified in this study shows strong diagnostic potential, and warrants further evaluation to determine true clinical efficacy., (C) 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - : The objective of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of automating the detection of abdominal free fluid in focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examinations. Perihepatic views from 10 FAST examinations with positive results and 10 FAST examinations with negative results were used. The sensitivity and specificity compared to manual classification by trained physicians was evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) were 100% (69.2%-100%) and 90.0% (55.5%-99.8%), respectively. These findings suggest that computerized detection of free fluid on abdominal ultrasound images may be sensitive and specific enough to aid clinicians in their interpretation of a FAST examination., (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Objectives: Predictive analytics in emergency care has mostly been limited to the use of clinical decision rules (CDRs) in the form of simple heuristics and scoring systems. In the development of CDRs, limitations in analytic methods and concerns with usability have generally constrained models to a preselected small set of variables judged to be clinically relevant and to rules that are easily calculated. Furthermore, CDRs frequently suffer from questions of generalizability, take years to develop, and lack the ability to be updated as new information becomes available. Newer analytic and machine learning techniques capable of harnessing the large number of variables that are already available through electronic health records (EHRs) may better predict patient outcomes and facilitate automation and deployment within clinical decision support systems. In this proof-of-concept study, a local, big data-driven, machine learning approach is compared to existing CDRs and traditional analytic methods using the prediction of sepsis in-hospital mortality as the use case., Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult ED visits admitted to the hospital meeting criteria for sepsis from October 2013 to October 2014. Sepsis was defined as meeting criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an infectious admitting diagnosis in the ED. ED visits were randomly partitioned into an 80%/20% split for training and validation. A random forest model (machine learning approach) was constructed using over 500 clinical variables from data available within the EHRs of four hospitals to predict in-hospital mortality. The machine learning prediction model was then compared to a classification and regression tree (CART) model, logistic regression model, and previously developed prediction tools on the validation data set using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and chi-square statistics., Results: There were 5,278 visits among 4,676 unique patients who met criteria for sepsis. Of the 4,222 patients in the training group, 210 (5.0%) died during hospitalization, and of the 1,056 patients in the validation group, 50 (4.7%) died during hospitalization. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the different models were as follows: random forest model, 0.86 (95% CI = 0.82 to 0.90); CART model, 0.69 (95% CI = 0.62 to 0.77); logistic regression model, 0.76 (95% CI = 0.69 to 0.82); CURB-65, 0.73 (95% CI = 0.67 to 0.80); MEDS, 0.71 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.77); and mREMS, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.79). The random forest model AUC was statistically different from all other models (p <= 0.003 for all comparisons)., Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept study, a local big data-driven, machine learning approach outperformed existing CDRs as well as traditional analytic techniques for predicting in-hospital mortality of ED patients with sepsis. Future research should prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and whether it translates into improved clinical outcomes for high-risk sepsis patients. The methods developed serve as an example of a new model for predictive analytics in emergency care that can be automated, applied to other clinical outcomes of interest, and deployed in EHRs to enable locally relevant clinical predictions., (C) 2016 The Society for Academic Medecine

AB  - To date, no studies have attempted to utilize data from a combination of vital signs, heart rate variability and complexity (HRV, HRC), as well as machine learning (ML), for identifying the need for lifesaving interventions (LSIs) in trauma patients. The objectives of this study were to examine the utility of the above for identifying LSI needs and compare different LSI-associated models, with the hypothesis that an ML model would be superior in performance over multivariate logistic regression models. One hundred four patients transported from the injury scene via helicopter were selected for the study. A wireless vital signs monitor was attached to the patient's arm and used to capture physiologic data, including HRV and HRC. The power of vital sign measurements, HRV, HRC, and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) to identify patients requiring LSIs was estimated using multivariate logistic regression and ML. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also obtained. Thirty-two patients underwent 75 LSIs. After logistic regression, ROC curves demonstrated better identification for LSIs using heart rate (HR) and HRC (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.81) than using HR alone (AUC of 0.73). Likewise, ROC curves demonstrated better identification for LSIs using GCS and HRC (AUC of 0.94) than using GCS and HR (AUC of 0.92). Importantly, ROC curves demonstrated that an ML model using HR, GCS, and HRC (AUC of 0.99) had superior performance over multivariate logistic regression models for identifying the need for LSIs in trauma patients. Development of computer decision support systems should utilize vital signs, HRC, and ML in order to achieve more accurate diagnostic capabilities, such as identification of needs for LSIs in trauma patients., (C) 2014 by the Shock Society

AB  - Objective: To develop a decision support system to identify patients at high risk for hyperlactatemia based upon routinely measured vital signs and laboratory studies., Materials and methods: Electronic health records of 741 adult patients at the University of California Davis Health System who met at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were used to associate patients' vital signs, white blood cell count (WBC), with sepsis occurrence and mortality. Generative and discriminative classification (naive Bayes, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models) were used to integrate heterogeneous patient data and form a predictive tool for the inference of lactate level and mortality risk., Results: An accuracy of 0.99 and discriminability of 1.00 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for lactate level prediction was obtained when the vital signs and WBC measurements were analysed in a 24 h time bin. An accuracy of 0.73 and discriminability of 0.73 AUC for mortality prediction in patients with sepsis was achieved with only three features: median of lactate levels, mean arterial pressure, and median absolute deviation of the respiratory rate., Discussion: This study introduces a new scheme for the prediction of lactate levels and mortality risk from patient vital signs and WBC. Accurate prediction of both these variables can drive the appropriate response by clinical staff and thus may have important implications for patient health and treatment outcome., Conclusions: Effective predictions of lactate levels and mortality risk can be provided with a few clinical variables when the temporal aspect and variability of patient data are considered., (C) 2014 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd

AB  - Background: In primary angioplasty (primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PPCI]) for acute myocardial infarction, institutional logistical delays can increase door-to-balloon times, resulting in increased mortality., Methods: We moved from a thrombolysis (TL) service to 24/7 PPCI for direct access and interhospital transfer in April 2004. Using autonomous ambulance diagnosis with open access to the myocardial infarction center catheter laboratory, we compared reperfusion times and clinical outcomes for the final 2 years of TL with the first 3 years of PPCI., Results: Comparison was made between TL (2002-2004, n = 185) and PPCI (2004-2007, n = 704); all times are medians in minutes (interquartile range): for TL, symptom to needle 153 (85-225), call to needle 58 (49-73), first professional contact (FPC) to needle 47 (39-63), door to needle 18 (12-30) (mortality: 7.6% at 30 days, 9.2% at 1 year); for interhospital transfer PPCI (n = 227), symptom to balloon 226 (175-350), call to balloon 135 (117-188), FPC to balloon 121 (102-166), first door-to-balloon 100 (80-142) (mortality: 7.0% at 30 days, 12.3% at 1 year); for direct-access PPCI (n = 477), symptom to balloon 142 (101-238), call to balloon 79 (70-93), FPC to balloon 69 (59-82), door to balloon 20 (16-29) (mortality: 4.6% at 30 days, 8.6% at 1 year). There was no difference between direct-access PPCI and TL times for symptom to needle/balloon. Direct-access PPCI was significantly quicker for the group than in-hospital thrombolysis for door to needle/balloon times due to the lack of any long wait patients (P < .001)., Conclusions: Interhospital transfer remains slow even with rapid institutional door-to-balloon times. With autonomous ambulance diagnosis and open access direct to the catheter laboratory, a median door-to-balloon time of <30 minutes day and night was achieved, and >95% of patients were reperfused within 1 hour., (C) Mosby-Year Book Inc. 2009.

AB  - Background: The development of TRISS was principally a search for variables that correlated with outcome. It is not known, however, if linear statistical models provide optimal results. Artificial intelligence techniques can answer this question and also determine the most important predictor variables., Methods: An artificial neural network, using 16 anatomic and physiologic predictor variables, was compared with the latest United Kingdom version of TRISS model., Results: Both methods were 89.6% correct, but TRISS was significantly better by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.941 vs. 0.921, p < 0.001). The artificial neural network, however, was better calibrated to the test data (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, 58.3 vs. 105.4). Head injury, age, and chest injury were the most important predictors by linear or nonlinear methods, whereas respiration rate, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure were underused., Conclusion: Prediction using linear statistics is adequate but not optimal. Only half the predictors have important predictive value, fewer still when using linear classification. The strongest predictors swamp any nonlinearity observed in other variables., (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this review is to assess the accuracy of machine learning methods in their application of triaging the acuity of patients presenting in the Emergency Care System (ECS). The population are patients that have contacted the ambulance service or turned up at the Emergency Department. The index test is a machine-learning algorithm that aims to stratify the acuity of incoming patients at initial triage. This is in comparison to either an existing decision support tool, clinical opinion or in the absence of these, no comparator. The outcome of this review is the calibration, discrimination and classification statistics., METHODS: Only derivation studies (with or without internal validation) were included. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and the grey literature were searched on the 14th December 2019. Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool and data was extracted using the CHARMS checklist. Discrimination (C-statistic) was a commonly reported model performance measure and therefore these statistics were represented as a range within each machine learning method. The majority of studies had poorly reported outcomes and thus a narrative synthesis of results was performed., RESULTS: There was a total of 92 models (from 25 studies) included in the review. There were two main triage outcomes: hospitalisation (56 models), and critical care need (25 models). For hospitalisation, neural networks and tree-based methods both had a median C-statistic of 0.81 (IQR 0.80-0.84, 0.79-0.82). Logistic regression had a median C-statistic of 0.80 (0.74-0.83). For critical care need, neural networks had a median C-statistic of 0.89 (0.86-0.91), tree based 0.85 (0.84-0.88), and logistic regression 0.83 (0.79-0.84)., CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning methods appear accurate in triaging undifferentiated patients entering the Emergency Care System. There was no clear benefit of using one technique over another; however, models derived by logistic regression were more transparent in reporting model performance. Future studies should adhere to reporting guidelines and use these at the protocol design stage., REGISTRATION AND FUNDING: This systematic review is registered on the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) and can be accessed online at the following URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020168696This study was funded by the NIHR as part of a Clinical Doctoral Research Fellowship.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) enables the non-invasive functional assessment of coronary artery stenosis. We evaluated the feasibility and potential clinical role of FFRCT in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain who underwent chest-pain CT (CPCT)., METHODS: For this retrospective IRB-approved study, we included 56 patients (median age: 62 years, 14 females) with acute chest pain who underwent CPCT and who had at least a mild (>=25% diameter) coronary artery stenosis. CPCT was evaluated for the presence of acute plaque rupture and vulnerable plaque features. FFRCT measurements were performed using a machine learning-based software. We assessed the agreement between the results from FFRCT and patient outcome (including results from invasive catheter angiography and from any non-invasive cardiac imaging test, final clinical diagnosis and revascularization) for a follow-up of 3 months., RESULTS: FFRCT was technically feasible in 38/56 patients (68%). Eleven of the 38 patients (29%) showed acute plaque rupture in CPCT; all of them underwent immediate coronary revascularization. Of the remaining 27 patients (71%), 16 patients showed vulnerable plaque features (59%), of whom 11 (69%) were diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 10 (63%) underwent coronary revascularization. In patients with vulnerable plaque features in CPCT, FFRCT had an agreement with outcome in 12/16 patients (75%). In patients without vulnerable plaque features (n=11), one patient showed myocardial ischemia (9%). In these patients, FFRCT and patient outcome showed an agreement in 10/11 patients (91%)., CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data show that FFRCT is feasible in patients with acute chest pain who undergo CPCT provided that image quality is sufficient. FFRCT has the potential to improve patient triage by reducing further downstream testing but appears of limited value in patients with CT signs of acute plaque rupture.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop machine learning (ML) and initial nursing assessment (INA)-based emergency department (ED) triage to predict adverse clinical outcome., METHODS: The retrospective study included ED visits between January 2016 and December 2017 that resulted in either intensive care unit admission or emergency room death. We trained four classifiers using logistic regression and a deep learning model on INA and low dimensional (LD) INA, logistic regression on the Korea Triage and acuity scale (KTAS) and Sequential Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). We varied the outcome ratio for external validation. Finally, variables of importance were identified using the random forest model's information gain. The four most influential variables were used for LD modeling for efficiency., RESULTS: A total of 86,304 patient visits were included, with an overall outcome rate of 3.5%. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the KTAS model were 76.8 (74.9-78.6) with logistic regression and 74.0 (72.1-75.9) for the SOFA model, while the AUC values of the INA model were 87.2 (85.9-88.6) and 87.6 (86.3-88.9) with logistic regression and deep learning, suggesting that the ML and INA-based triage system result more accurately predicted the outcomes. The AUC values for the LD model were 81.2 (79.4-82.9) and 80.7 (78.9-82.5) for logistic regression and deep learning, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: We developed an ML and INA-based triage system for EDs. The novel system was able to predict clinical outcomes more accurately than existing triage systems, KTAS and SOFA. Copyright © 2020 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To predict 72-h and 9-day emergency department (ED) return by using gradient boosting on an expansive set of clinical variables from the electronic health record., METHODS: This retrospective study included all adult discharges from a level 1 trauma center ED and a community hospital ED covering the period of March 2013 to July 2017. A total of 1500 variables were extracted for each visit, and samples split randomly into training, validation, and test sets (80%, 10%, and 10%). Gradient boosting models were fit on 3 selections of the data: administrative data (demographics, prior hospital usage, and comorbidity categories), data available at triage, and the full set of data available at discharge. A logistic regression (LR) model built on administrative data was used for baseline comparison. Finally, the top 20 most informative variables identified from the full gradient boosting models were used to build a reduced model for each outcome., RESULTS: A total of 330 631 discharges were available for analysis, with 29 058 discharges (8.8%) resulting in 72-h return and 52 748 discharges (16.0%) resulting in 9-day return to either ED. LR models using administrative data yielded test AUCs of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.70) and 0.71(95% CI 0.70-0.72), while gradient boosting models using administrative data yielded test AUCs of 0.73 (95% CI 0.72-0.74) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.73-0.74) for 72-h and 9-day return, respectively. Gradient boosting models using variables available at triage yielded test AUCs of 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.76) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.75), while those using the full set of variables yielded test AUCs of 0.76 (95% CI 0.75-0.77) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.75-0.76). Reduced models using the top 20 variables yielded test AUCs of 0.73 (95% CI 0.71-0.74) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.72-0.74)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Gradient boosting models leveraging clinical data are superior to LR models built on administrative data at predicting 72-h and 9-day returns.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Triage is a process to accurately assess and classify symptoms to identify and provide rapid treatment to patients. The Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) is used as a triage instrument in all emergency centers. The aim of this study was to train and compare machine learning models to predict KTAS levels., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using data from a single emergency department of a tertiary university hospital. Information collected during triage was used in the analysis. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost were used to predict the KTAS level., RESULTS: The models with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were the random forest and XGBoost models trained on the entire dataset (AUROC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval 0.917-0.925 and AUROC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval 0.918-0.925, respectively). The AUROC of the models trained on the clinical data was higher than that of models trained on text data only, but the models trained on all variables had the highest AUROC among similar machine learning models., CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning can robustly predict the KTAS level at triage, which may have many possibilities for use, and the addition of text data improves the predictive performance compared to that achieved by using structured data alone.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems which are capable of doing human intelligence tasks such as decision making and problem solving. AI-based tools have been used for predicting various factors in medicine including risk stratification, diagnosis and choice of treatment. AI can also be of considerable help in emergency departments, especially patients' triage., OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the application of AI in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain to estimate emergency severity index version 4 (ESI-4) score without the estimate of the required resources., METHODS: A mixed-model approach was used for predicting the ESI-4 score. Seventy percent of the patient cases were used for training the models and the remaining 30% for testing the accuracy of the models. During the training phase, patients were randomly selected and were given to systems for analysis. The output, which was the level of triage, was compared with the gold standard (emergency medicine physician). During the test phase of the study, another group of randomly selected patients were evaluated by the systems and the results were then compared with the gold standard., RESULTS: Totally, 215 patients who were triaged by the emergency medicine specialist were enrolled in the study. Triage Levels 1 and 5 were omitted due to low number of cases. In triage Level 2, all systems showed fair level of prediction with Neural Network being the highest. In Level 3, all systems again showed fair level of prediction. However, in triage Level 4, decision tree was the only system with fair prediction., CONCLUSION: The application of AI in triage of patients with acute abdominal pain resulted in a model with acceptable level of accuracy. The model works with optimized number of input variables for quick assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishing rapport and empathy between patients and their health care provider is important but challenging in the context of a busy and crowded emergency department (ED)., OBJECTIVE: We explore the hypotheses that rapport building, documentation, and time efficiency might be improved in the ED by providing patients a digital tool that uses Bayesian reasoning-based techniques to gather relevant symptoms and history for handover to clinicians., METHODS: A 2-phase pilot evaluation was carried out in the ED of a German tertiary referral and major trauma hospital that treats an average of 120 patients daily. Phase 1 observations guided iterative improvement of the digital tool, which was then further evaluated in phase 2. All patients who were willing and able to provide consent were invited to participate, excluding those with severe injury or illness requiring immediate treatment, with traumatic injury, incapable of completing a health assessment, and aged <18 years. Over an 18-day period with 1699 patients presenting to the ED, 815 (47.96%) were eligible based on triage level. With available recruitment staff, 135 were approached, of whom 81 (60%) were included in the study. In a mixed methods evaluation, patients entered information into the tool, accessed by clinicians through a dashboard. All users completed evaluation Likert-scale questionnaires rating the tool's performance. The feasibility of a larger trial was evaluated through rates of recruitment and questionnaire completion., RESULTS: Respondents strongly endorsed the tool for facilitating conversation (61/81, 75% of patients, 57/78, 73% of physician ratings, and 10/10, 100% of nurse ratings). Most nurses judged the tool as potentially time saving, whereas most physicians only agreed for a subset of medical specialties (eg, surgery). Patients reported high usability and understood the tool's questions. The tool was recommended by most patients (63/81, 78%), in 53% (41/77) of physician ratings, and in 76% (61/80) of nurse ratings. Questionnaire completion rates were 100% (81/81) by patients and 96% (78/81 enrolled patients) by physicians., CONCLUSIONS: This pilot confirmed that a larger study in the setting would be feasible. The tool has clear potential to improve patient-health care provider interaction and could also contribute to ED efficiency savings. Future research and development will extend the range of patients for whom the history-taking tool has clinical utility., TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00024115; https://drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00024115.

AB  - Accurate stratification of sepsis can effectively guide the triage of patient care and shared decision making in the emergency department (ED). However, previous research on sepsis identification models focused mainly on ICU patients, and discrepancies in model performance between the development and external validation datasets are rarely evaluated. The aim of our study was to develop and externally validate a machine learning model to stratify sepsis patients in the ED. We retrospectively collected clinical data from two geographically separate institutes that provided a different level of care at different time periods. The Sepsis-3 criteria were used as the reference standard in both datasets for identifying true sepsis cases. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was developed to stratify sepsis patients and the performance of the model was compared with traditional clinical sepsis tools; quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). There were 8296 patients (1752 (21%) being septic) in the development and 1744 patients (506 (29%) being septic) in the external validation datasets. The mortality of septic patients in the development and validation datasets was 13.5% and 17%, respectively. In the internal validation, XGBoost achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86, exceeding SIRS (0.68) and qSOFA (0.56). The performance of XGBoost deteriorated in the external validation (the AUROC of XGBoost, SIRS and qSOFA was 0.75, 0.57 and 0.66, respectively). Heterogeneity in patient characteristics, such as sepsis prevalence, severity, age, comorbidity and infection focus, could reduce model performance. Our model showed good discriminative capabilities for the identification of sepsis patients and outperformed the existing sepsis identification tools. Implementation of the ML model in the ED can facilitate timely sepsis identification and treatment. However, dataset discrepancies should be carefully evaluated before implementing the ML approach in clinical practice. This finding reinforces the necessity for future studies to perform external validation to ensure the generalisability of any developed ML approaches.

AB  - Introduction: Patients boarding in the Emergency Department can contribute to overcrowding, leading to longer waiting times and patients leaving without being seen or completing their treatment. The early identification of potential admissions could act as an additional decision support tool to alert clinicians that a patient needs to be reviewed for admission and would also be of benefit to bed managers in advance bed planning for the patient. We aim to create a low-dimensional model predicting admissions early from the paediatric Emergency Department. Methods and Analysis: The methodology Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) will be followed. The dataset will comprise of 2 years of data, ~76,000 records. Potential predictors were identified from previous research, comprising of demographics, registration details, triage assessment, hospital usage and past medical history. Fifteen models will be developed comprised of 3 machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, naive Bayes and gradient boosting machine) and 5 sampling methods, 4 of which are aimed at addressing class imbalance (undersampling, oversampling, and synthetic oversampling techniques). The variables of importance will then be identified from the optimal model (selected based on the highest Area under the curve) and used to develop an additional low-dimensional model for deployment. Discussion: A low-dimensional model comprised of routinely collected data, captured up to post triage assessment would benefit many hospitals without data rich platforms for the development of models with a high number of predictors. Novel to the planned study is the use of data from the Republic of Ireland and the application of sampling techniques aimed at improving model performance impacted by an imbalance between admissions and discharges in the outcome variable.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid and accurate triage of patients at the emergency department is critical to inform decision-making. We propose a data-driven approach for automatic prediction of deterioration risk using a deep neural network that learns from chest X-ray images, and a gradient boosting model that learns from routine clinical variables. Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3,661 patients, achieves an AUC of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.742-0.827) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions, and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at NYU Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time. In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for assisting front-line physicians in the triage of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteremia is a common but critical condition with high mortality that requires timely and optimal treatment in the emergency department (ED). The prediction of bacteremia at the ED during triage and disposition stages could support the clinical decisions of ED physicians regarding the appropriate treatment course and safe ED disposition. This study developed and validated machine learning models to predict bacteremia in the emergency department during triage and disposition stages., METHODS: This study enrolled adult patients who visited a single tertiary hospital from 2016 to 2018 and had at least two sets of blood cultures during their ED stay. Demographic information, chief complaint, triage level, vital signs, and laboratory data were used as model predictors. We developed and validated prediction models using 10 variables at the time of ED triage and 42 variables at the time of disposition. The extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model was compared with the random forest and multivariable logistic regression models. We compared model performance by assessing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), test characteristics, and decision curve analysis., RESULTS: A total of 24,768 patients were included: 16,197 cases were assigned to development, and 8571 cases were assigned to validation. The proportion of bacteremia was 10.9% and 10.4% in the development and validation datasets, respectively. The Triage XGB model (AUC, 0.718; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.701-0.735) showed acceptable discrimination performance with a sensitivity over 97%. The Disposition XGB model (AUC, 0.853; 95% CI, 0.840-0.866) showed excellent performance and provided the greatest net benefit throughout the range of thresholds probabilities., CONCLUSIONS: The Triage XGB model could be used to identify patients with a low risk of bacteremia immediately after initial ED triage. The Disposition XGB model showed excellent discriminative performance. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid revascularization is the key to better patient outcomes in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Direct activation of cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) using artificial intelligence (AI) interpretation of initial electrocardiography (ECG) might help reduce door-to-balloon (D2B) time. To prove that this approach is feasible and beneficial, we assessed the non-inferiority of such a process over conventional evaluation and estimated its clinical benefits, including a reduction in D2B time, medical cost, and 1-year mortality., METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study of emergency department (ED) patients suspected of having STEMI from January 2021 to June 2021. Quantitative ECG (QCG TM), a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation system, was used for screening. The non-inferiority of the AI-driven CCL activation over joint clinical evaluation by emergency physicians and cardiologists was tested using a 5% non-inferiority margin., RESULTS: Eighty patients (STEMI, 54 patients [67.5%]) were analyzed. The area under the curve of QCG score was 0.947. Binned at 50 (binary QCG), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 98.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.6%, 100.0%), 76.9% (95% CI, 60.7%, 93.1%), 89.8% (95% CI, 82.1%, 97.5%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 86.1%, 100.0%), respectively. The difference in sensitivity and specificity between binary QCG and the joint clinical decision was 3.7% (95% CI, -3.5%, 10.9%) and 19.2% (95% CI, -4.7%, 43.1%), respectively, confirming the non-inferiority. The estimated median reduction in D2B time, evaluation cost, and the relative risk of 1-year mortality were 11.0 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 7.3-20.0 minutes), 26,902.2 KRW (22.78 USD) per STEMI patient, and 12.39% (IQR, 7.51-22.54%), respectively., CONCLUSION: AI-assisted CCL activation using initial ECG is feasible. If such a policy is implemented, it would be reasonable to expect some reduction in D2B time, medical cost, and 1-year mortality. Copyright © 2022 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research aims to (i) identify latent subgroups of ED presentations in Australian public EDs using a data-driven approach and (ii) compare clinical, socio-demographic and time-related characteristics of ED presentations broadly using the subgroups., METHODS: We examined presentations to four public hospital EDs in Queensland from 2009 to 2014. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm, Clustering Large Applications, was used to cluster ED presentations., RESULTS: There were six subgroups common across the EDs, primarily distinguishable by age, and subsequently by triage category, ED length of stay, arrival mode, departure status and several time-related attributes. Around 10% to 30% of the total presentations had high resource utilisation, with half of these from older patients (55+ years). ED resource utilisation per population was highest among the oldest cohort (75+ years). Children and young adults more frequently presented to the ED outside general-practitioner hours, mostly on Sundays. Older persons were more likely to present at any time, rather than specific hours, days or seasons. ED service performance measured against commonly used access-target indicators were rarely satisfied for older people and frequently satisfied for children., CONCLUSION: Clustering Large Applications is effective in finding latent groups in large-scale mixed-type data, as demonstrated in the present study. Six types of ED presentations were identified and described using clinically relevant characteristics. The present study provides evidence for policy makers in Australia to develop alternative ED models of care tailored around the care needs of the differing groups of patients and thereby supports the sustainable delivery of acute healthcare.

AB  - The machine learning-assisted electrocardiogram (ECG) is increasingly recognized for its unprecedented capabilities in diagnosing and predicting cardiovascular diseases. Identifying the need for ECG examination early in emergency department (ED) triage is key to timely artificial intelligence-assisted analysis. We used machine learning to develop and validate a clinical decision support tool to predict ED triage patients' need for ECG. Data from 301,658 ED visits from August 2017 to November 2020 in a tertiary hospital were divided into a development cohort, validation cohort, and two test cohorts that included admissions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Models were developed using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost methods. Their areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs) were compared and validated. In the validation cohort, the AUCs were 0.887 for the XGBoost model, 0.885 for the logistic regression model, 0.878 for the random forest model, and 0.845 for the decision tree model. The XGBoost model was selected for subsequent application. In test cohort 1, the AUC was 0.891, with sensitivity of 0.812, specificity of 0.814, PPV of 0.708 and NPV of 0.886. In test cohort 2, the AUC was 0.885, with sensitivity of 0.816, specificity of 0.812, PPV of 0.659, and NPV of 0.908. In the cumulative incidence analysis, patients not receiving an ECG yet positively predicted by the model had significantly higher probability of receiving the examination within 48 h compared with those negatively predicted by the model. A machine learning model based on triage datasets was developed to predict ECG acquisition with high accuracy. The ECG recommendation can effectively predict whether patients presenting at ED triage will require an ECG, prompting subsequent analysis and decision-making in the ED.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Uncertainty in patients' COVID-19 status contributes to treatment delays, nosocomial transmission, and operational pressures in hospitals. However, the typical turnaround time for laboratory PCR remains 12-24 h and lateral flow devices (LFDs) have limited sensitivity. Previously, we have shown that artificial intelligence-driven triage (CURIAL-1.0) can provide rapid COVID-19 screening using clinical data routinely available within 1 h of arrival to hospital. Here, we aimed to improve the time from arrival to the emergency department to the availability of a result, do external and prospective validation, and deploy a novel laboratory-free screening tool in a UK emergency department. Method(s): We optimised our previous model, removing less informative predictors to improve generalisability and speed, developing the CURIAL-Lab model with vital signs and readily available blood tests (full blood count [FBC]; urea, creatinine, and electrolytes; liver function tests; and C-reactive protein) and the CURIAL-Rapide model with vital signs and FBC alone. Models were validated externally for emergency admissions to University Hospitals Birmingham, Bedfordshire Hospitals, and Portsmouth Hospitals University National Health Service (NHS) trusts, and prospectively at Oxford University Hospitals, by comparison with PCR testing. Next, we compared model performance directly against LFDs and evaluated a combined pathway that triaged patients who had either a positive CURIAL model result or a positive LFD to a COVID-19-suspected clinical area. Lastly, we deployed CURIAL-Rapide alongside an approved point-of-care FBC analyser to provide laboratory-free COVID-19 screening at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK). Our primary improvement outcome was time-to-result, and our performance measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Finding(s): 72 223 patients met eligibility criteria across the four validating hospital groups, in a total validation period spanning Dec 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. CURIAL-Lab and CURIAL-Rapide performed consistently across trusts (AUROC range 0.858-0.881, 95% CI 0.838-0.912, for CURIAL-Lab and 0.836-0.854, 0.814-0.889, for CURIAL-Rapide), achieving highest sensitivity at Portsmouth Hospitals (84.1%, Wilson's 95% CI 82.5-85.7, for CURIAL-Lab and 83.5%, 81.8-85.1, for CURIAL-Rapide) at specificities of 71.3% (70.9-71.8) for CURIAL-Lab and 63.6% (63.1-64.1) for CURIAL-Rapide. When combined with LFDs, model predictions improved triage sensitivity from 56.9% (51.7-62.0) for LFDs alone to 85.6% with CURIAL-Lab (81.6-88.9; AUROC 0.925) and 88.2% with CURIAL-Rapide (84.4-91.1; AUROC 0.919), thereby reducing missed COVID-19 cases by 65% with CURIAL-Lab and 72% with CURIAL-Rapide. For the prospective deployment of CURIAL-Rapide, 520 patients were enrolled for point-of-care FBC analysis between Feb 18 and May 10, 2021, of whom 436 received confirmatory PCR testing and ten (2.3%) tested positive. Median time from arrival to a CURIAL-Rapide result was 45 min (IQR 32-64), 16 min (26.3%) sooner than with LFDs (61 min, 37-99; log-rank p<0.0001), and 6 h 52 min (90.2%) sooner than with PCR (7 h 37 min, 6 h 5 min to 15 h 39 min; p<0.0001). Classification performance was high, with sensitivity of 87.5% (95% CI 52.9-97.8), specificity of 85.4% (81.3-88.7), and negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.2-99.9). CURIAL-Rapide correctly excluded infection for 31 (58.5%) of 53 patients who were triaged by a physician to a COVID-19-suspected area but went on to test negative by PCR. Interpretation(s): Our findings show the generalisability, performance, and real-world operational benefits of artificial intelligence-driven screening for COVID-19 over standard-of-care in emergency departments. CURIAL-Rapide provided rapid, laboratory-free screening when used with near-patient FBC analysis, and was able to reduce the number of patients who tested negative for COVID-19 but were triaged to COVID-19-suspected areas.

AB  - Background: Early recognition and treatment of sepsis are crucial for improving patient outcomes. However, the diagnosis of sepsis remains challenging because of vague clinical presentations. Objective(s): We aim to developed novel sepsis screening tools with machine learning models and compared their performance with traditional methods. Method(s): We used machine learning algorithms to develop models for early risk prediction of sepsis based on retrospective single-center electronic health record data from adult patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) from June 2018 through May 2020. Available triage data including vital signs, baseline characteristics, and chief complaints served as predictors. In our study, 80% and 20% of the data were randomly split into training and testing sets, respectively. Derived from the training set, we built the models based on four machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest, and neural network. Our primary outcome was the model performance that predicted the final diagnosis of sepsis determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive performance compared with those of the reference models (quick sequential organ failure assessment [qSOFA], modified early warning score [MEWS], and systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS]) using the testing dataset. Result(s): In total, 133,707 ED visits were analyzed. All machine learning models outperformed the reference models by achieving a higher AUROC (e.g., AUROC 0.931 [95% CI 0.921-0.944] in our best model (random forest algorithm) vs 0.635 [95% CI 0.613-0.660] in qSOFA, 0.688 [95% CI 0.662-0.715] in MEWS, and 0.814 [95% CI 0.794-0.833] in SIRS). Conclusion(s): The machine learning models demonstrated superior performance in prediction of sepsis diagnosis among emergency patients compared with that using the traditional screening tools. Further studies are needed to determine whether the models will enhance physicians' judgments and improve patient outcomes.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Bacteremia is a common but critical condition with high mortality that requires timely and optimal treatment in the emergency department (ED). The prediction of bacteremia at the ED during triage and disposition stages could support the clinical decisions of ED physicians regarding the appropriate treatment course and safe ED disposition. This study developed and validated machine learning models to predict bacteremia in the emergency department during triage and disposition stages. Method(s): This study enrolled adult patients who visited a single tertiary hospital from 2016 to 2018 and had at least two sets of blood cultures during their ED stay. Demographic information, chief complaint, triage level, vital signs, and laboratory data were used as model predictors. We developed and validated prediction models using 10 variables at the time of ED triage and 42 variables at the time of disposition. The extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model was compared with the random forest and multivariable logistic regression models. We compared model performance by assessing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), test characteristics, and decision curve analysis. Result(s): A total of 24,768 patients were included: 16,197 cases were assigned to development, and 8571 cases were assigned to validation. The proportion of bacteremia was 10.9% and 10.4% in the development and validation datasets, respectively. The Triage XGB model (AUC, 0.718; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.701-0.735) showed acceptable discrimination performance with a sensitivity over 97%. The Disposition XGB model (AUC, 0.853; 95% CI, 0.840-0.866) showed excellent performance and provided the greatest net benefit throughout the range of thresholds probabilities. Conclusion(s): The Triage XGB model could be used to identify patients with a low risk of bacteremia immediately after initial ED triage. The Disposition XGB model showed excellent discriminative performance.Copyright © 2022

AB  - BACKGROUND: In emergency services is important to accurately assess and classify symptoms, which may be improved with the help of technology. One mechanism that could help and improve predictions from health records or patient flow is machine learning (ML). AIM: To analyse the effectiveness of ML systems in triage for making predictions at the emergency department in comparison with other triage scales/scores. METHOD(S): Following the PRISMA recommendations, a systematic review was conducted using CINAHL, Cochrane, Cuiden, Medline and Scopus databases with the search equation "Machine learning AND triage AND emergency". RESULT(S): Eleven studies were identified. The studies show that the use of ML methods consistently predict important outcomes like mortality, critical care outcomes and admission, and the need for hospitalization in comparison with scales like Emergency Severity Index or others. Among the ML models considered, XGBoost and Deep Neural Networks obtained the highest levels of prediction accuracy, while Logistic Regression performed obtained the worst values. CONCLUSION(S): Machine learning methods can be a good instrument for helping triage process with the prediction of important emergency variables like mortality or the need for critical care or hospitalization.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Timely assessment to accurately prioritize patients is crucial for emergency department (ED) management. Urgent (i.e., level-3, on a 5-level emergency severity index system) patients have become a challenge since under-triage and over-triage often occur. This study was aimed to develop a computational model by artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies to accurately predict urgent patient outcomes using data that are readily available in most ED triage systems. We retrospectively collected data from the ED of a tertiary teaching hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. Eleven variables were used for data analysis and prediction model building, including 1 response, 2 demographic, and 8 clinical variables. A model to predict hospital admission was developed using neural networks and machine learning methodologies. A total of 282,971 samples of urgent (level-3) visits were included in the analysis. Our model achieved a validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8004 (95% CI 0.7963-0.8045). The optimal cutoff value identified by Youden's index for determining hospital admission was 0.5517. Using this cutoff value, the sensitivity was 0.6721 (95% CI 0.6624-0.6818), and the specificity was 0.7814 (95% CI 0.7777-0.7851), with a positive predictive value of 0.3660 (95% CI 0.3586-0.3733) and a negative predictive value of 0.9270 (95% CI 0.9244-0.9295). Subgroup analysis revealed that this model performed better in the nontraumatic adult subgroup and achieved a validation AUC of 0.8166 (95% CI 0.8199-0.8212). Our AI model accurately assessed the need for hospitalization for urgent patients, which constituted nearly 70% of ED visits. This model demonstrates the potential for streamlining ED operations using a very limited number of variables that are readily available in most ED triage systems. Subgroup analysis is an important topic for future investigation.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - An early-warning model to predict in-hospital mortality on admission of COVID-19 patients at an emergency department (ED) was developed and validated using a machine-learning model. In total, 2782 patients were enrolled between March 2020 and December 2020, including 2106 patients (first wave) and 676 patients (second wave) in the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The first-wave patients were divided into two groups with 1474 patients used to train the model, and 632 to validate it. The 676 patients in the second wave were used to test the model. Age, 17 blood analytes, and Brescia chest X-ray score were the variables processed using a random forests classification algorithm to build and validate the model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the model performances. A web-based death-risk calculator was implemented and integrated within the Laboratory Information System of the hospital. The final score was constructed by age (the most powerful predictor), blood analytes (the strongest predictors were lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte %, ferritin std, and monocyte %), and Brescia chest X-ray score (https://bdbiomed.shinyapps.io/covid- 19score/). The areas under the ROC curve obtained for the three groups (training, validating, and testing) were 0.98, 0.83, and 0.78, respectively. The model predicts in-hospital mortality on the basis of data that can be obtained in a short time, directly at the ED on admission. It functions as a web- based calculator, providing a risk score which is easy to interpret. It can be used in the triage process to support the decision on patient allocation.Copyright © Garrafa et al.

AB  - Objective: To develop prediction models for intensive care unit (ICU) vs non-ICU level-of-care need within 24 hours of inpatient admission for emergency department (ED) patients using electronic health record data. Material(s) and Method(s): Using records of 41 654 ED visits to a tertiary academic center from 2015 to 2019, we tested 4 algorithms - feed-forward neural networks, regularized regression, random forests, and gradient-boosted trees - to predict ICU vs non-ICU level-of-care within 24 hours and at the 24th hour following admission. Simple-feature models included patient demographics, Emergency Severity Index (ESI), and vital sign summary. Complex-feature models added all vital signs, lab results, and counts of diagnosis, imaging, procedures, medications, and lab orders. Result(s): The best-performing model, a gradient-boosted tree using a full feature set, achieved an AUROC of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.87-0.89) and AUPRC of 0.65 (95%CI: 0.63-0.68) for predicting ICU care need within 24 hours of admission. The logistic regression model using ESI achieved an AUROC of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.65-0.70) and AUPRC of 0.37 (95%CI: 0.35-0.40). Using a discrimination threshold, such as 0.6, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity were 85%, 89%, 30%, and 99%, respectively. Vital signs were the most important predictors. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Undertriaging admitted ED patients who subsequently require ICU care is common and associated with poorer outcomes. Machine learning models using readily available electronic health record data predict subsequent need for ICU admission with good discrimination, substantially better than the benchmarking ESI system. The results could be used in a multitiered clinical decision-support system to improve ED triage. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Emergency department triage is the first point in time when a patient's acuity level is determined. The time to assign a priority at triage is short and it is vital to accurately stratify patients at this stage, since under-triage can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Our aim was to present a model that can assist healthcare professionals in triage decision making, namely in the stratification of patients through the risk prediction of a composite critical outcome-mortality and cardiopulmonary arrest. Our study cohort consisted of 235826 adult patients triaged at a Portuguese Emergency Department from 2012 to 2016. Patients were assigned to emergent, very urgent or urgent priorities of the Manchester Triage System (MTS). Demographics, clinical variables routinely collected at triage and the patients' chief complaint were used. Logistic regression, random forests and extreme gradient boosting were developed using all available variables. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) natural language processing weighting factor was applied to vectorize the chief complaint. Stratified random sampling was used to split the data into train (70%) and test (30%) data sets. Ten-fold cross validation was performed in train to optimize model hyper-parameters. The performance obtained with the best model was compared against the reference model-a regularized logistic regression trained using only triage priorities. Extreme gradient boosting exhibited good calibration properties and yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.26-0.36), respectively. The predictors ranked with higher importance by this model were the Glasgow coma score, the patients' age, pulse oximetry and arrival mode. Compared to the reference, the extreme gradient boosting model using clinical variables and the chief complaint presented higher recall for patients assigned MTS-3 and can identify those who are at risk of the composite outcome.Copyright © 2020 Fernandes et al.

AB  - Motivation: The timely identification of patients for hospitalization in emergency departments (EDs) can facilitate efficient use of hospital resources. Machine learning can help the early prediction of ED disposition; however, application of machine learning models requires both computer science skills and domain knowledge. This presents a barrier for those who want to apply machine learning to real-world settings. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to construct a competitive predictive model with a minimal amount of human effort to facilitate decisions regarding hospitalization of patients. Method(s): This study used the electronic health record data from five EDs in a single healthcare system, including an academic urban children's hospital ED, from January 2009 to December 2013. We constructed two machine learning models by using automated machine learning algorithm (autoML) which allows non-experts to use machine learning model: one with data only available at ED triage, the other adding information available one hour into the ED visit. Random forest and logistic regression were employed as bench-marking models. The ratio of the training dataset to the test dataset was 8:2, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, and F1 were calculated to assess the quality of the models. Result(s): Of the 9,069 ED visits analyzed, the study population was made up of males (62.7 %), median (IQR) age was 6 (4, 10) years, and public insurance coverage (66.0 %). The majority had an Emergency Severity Index score of 3 (52.9 %). The prevalence of hospitalization was 22.5 %. The AUCs were 0.914 and 0.942. AUCs were 0.831 and 0.886 for random forests, and 0.795 and 0.823 for logistic regression. Among the predictors, an outcome at a prior visit, ESI level, time to first medication, and time to triage were the most important features for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Conclusion(s): In comparison with the conventional approaches, the use of autoML improved the predictive ability for the need for hospitalization. The findings can optimize ED management, hospital-level resource utilization and improve quality. Furthermore, this approach can support the design of a more effective patient ED flow for pediatric asthma care.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Early detection and intervention are the key factors for improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Objective(s): The objective of this observational longitudinal study was to identify nonoverlapping severity subgroups (ie, clusters) among patients with COVID-19, based exclusively on clinical data and standard laboratory tests obtained during patient assessment in the emergency department. Method(s): We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols. Result(s): From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests - the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils - were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3. Conclusion(s): A few standard laboratory tests, deemed available in all emergency departments, have shown good discriminative power for the characterization of severity subgroups among patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Background: Acute stroke is an urgent medical condition that requires immediate assessment and treatment. Prompt identification of patients with suspected stroke at emergency department (ED) triage followed by timely activation of code stroke systems is the key to successful management of stroke. While false negative detection of stroke may prevent patients from receiving optimal treatment, excessive false positive alarms will substantially burden stroke neurologists. This study aimed to develop a stroke-alert trigger to identify patients with suspected stroke at ED triage. Method(s): Patients who arrived at the ED within 12 h of symptom onset and were suspected of a stroke or transient ischemic attack or triaged with a stroke-related symptom were included. Clinical features at ED triage were collected, including the presenting complaint, triage level, self-reported medical history (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and prior stroke), vital signs, and presence of atrial fibrillation. Three rule-based algorithms, ie, Face Arm Speech Test (FAST) and two flavors of Balance, Eyes, FAST (BE-FAST), and six machine learning (ML) techniques with various resampling methods were used to build classifiers for identification of patients with suspected stroke. Logistic regression (LR) was used to find important features. Result(s): The study population consisted of 1361 patients. The values of area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) were 0.737, 0.710, and 0.562 for the FAST, BE-FAST-1, and BE-FAST-2 models, respectively. The values of AUPRC for the top three ML models were 0.787 for classification and regression tree with undersampling, 0.783 for LR with synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and 0.782 for LR with class weighting. Among the ML models, logistic regression and random forest models in general achieved higher values of AUPRC, in particular in those with class weighting or SMOTE to handle class imbalance problem. In addition to the presenting complaint and triage level, age, diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate, were also important features for developing a stroke-alert trigger. Conclusion(s): ML techniques significantly improved the performance of prediction models for identification of patients with suspected stroke. Such ML models can be embedded in the electronic triage system for clinical decision support at ED triage.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Early identification of emergency department (ED) patients who need hospitalization is essential for quality of care and patient safety. We aimed to compare machine learning (ML) models predicting the hospitalization of ED patients and conventional regression techniques at three points in time after ED registration. Method(s): We analyzed consecutive ED patients of three hospitals using the Netherlands Emergency Department Evaluation Database (NEED). We developed prediction models for hospitalization using an increasing number of data available at triage, ~30 min (including vital signs) and ~2 h (including laboratory tests) after ED registration, using ML (random forest, gradient boosted decision trees, deep neural networks) and multivariable logistic regression analysis (including spline transformations for continuous predictors). Demographics, urgency, presenting complaints, disease severity and proxies for comorbidity, and complexity were used as covariates. We compared the performance using the area under the ROC curve in independent validation sets from each hospital. Result(s): We included 172,104 ED patients of whom 66,782 (39 %) were hospitalized. The AUC of the multivariable logistic regression model was 0.82 (0.78-0.86) at triage, 0.84 (0.81-0.86) at ~30 min and 0.83 (0.75-0.92) after ~2 h. The best performing ML model over time was the gradient boosted decision trees model with an AUC of 0.84 (0.77-0.88) at triage, 0.86 (0.82-0.89) at ~30 min and 0.86 (0.74-0.93) after ~2 h. Conclusion(s): Our study showed that machine learning models had an excellent but similar predictive performance as the logistic regression model for predicting hospital admission. In comparison to the 30-min model, the 2-h model did not show a performance improvement. After further validation, these prediction models could support management decisions by real-time feedback to medical personal.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

AB  - In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been promisingly applied in many fields of clinical medicine, both for diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Aims of this narrative review were to summarize the basic concepts of ML applied to clinical medicine and explore its main applications in the emergency department (ED) setting, with a particular focus on syncope management. Through an extensive literature search in PubMed and Embase, we found increasing evidence suggesting that the use of ML algorithms can improve ED triage, diagnosis, and risk stratification of many diseases. However, the lacks of external validation and reliable diagnostic standards currently limit their implementation in clinical practice. Syncope represents a challenging problem for the emergency physician both because its diagnosis is not supported by specific tests and the available prognostic tools proved to be inefficient. ML algorithms have the potential to overcome these limitations and, in the future, they could support the clinician in managing syncope patients more efficiently. However, at present only few studies have addressed this issue, albeit with encouraging results.

AB  - Importance: While machine learning approaches may enhance prediction ability, little is known about their utility in emergency department (ED) triage. Objective(s): To examine the performance of machine learning approaches to predict clinical outcomes and disposition in children in the ED and to compare their performance with conventional triage approaches. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Prognostic study of ED data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2015. A nationally representative sample of 52037 children aged 18 years or younger who presented to the ED were included. Data analysis was performed in August 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes were critical care (admission to an intensive care unit and/or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the training set (70% random sample), using routinely available triage data as predictors (eg, demographic characteristics and vital signs), we derived 4 machine learning-based models: lasso regression, random forest, gradient-boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. In the test set (the remaining 30% of the sample), we measured the models' prediction performance by computing C statistics, prospective prediction results, and decision curves. These machine learning models were built for each outcome and compared with the reference model using the conventional triage classification information. Result(s): Of 52037 eligible ED visits by children (median [interquartile range] age, 6 [2-14] years; 24929 [48.0%] female), 163 (0.3%) had the critical care outcome and 2352 (4.5%) had the hospitalization outcome. For the critical care prediction, all machine learning approaches had higher discriminative ability compared with the reference model, although the difference was not statistically significant (eg, C statistics of 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.92] for the deep neural network vs 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71-0.85] for the reference; P =.16), and lower number of undertriaged critically ill children in the conventional triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to nonurgent). For the hospitalization prediction, all machine learning approaches had significantly higher discrimination ability (eg, C statistic, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.78-0.81] for the deep neural network vs 0.73 [95% CI, 0.71-0.75] for the reference; P <.001) and fewer overtriaged children who did not require inpatient management in the conventional triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). The decision curve analysis demonstrated a greater net benefit of machine learning models over ranges of clinical thresholds. Conclusions and Relevance: Machine learning-based triage had better discrimination ability to predict clinical outcomes and disposition, with reduction in undertriaging critically ill children and overtriaging children who are less ill..Copyright © 2019 American Medical Association.

AB  - Introduction Patients with sepsis who present to an emergency department (ED) have highly variable underlying disease severity, and can be categorized from low to high risk. Development of a risk stratification tool for these patients is important for appropriate triage and early treatment. The aim of this study was to develop machine learning models predicting 31-day mortality in patients presenting to the ED with sepsis and to compare these to internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores. Methods A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted amongst 1,344 emergency department patients fulfilling sepsis criteria. Laboratory and clinical data that was available in the first two hours of presentation from these patients were randomly partitioned into a development (n = 1,244) and validation dataset (n = 100). Machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the development dataset and compared to internal medicine physicians and risk scores in the independent validation dataset. The primary outcome was 31-day mortality. Results A number of 1,344 patients were included of whom 174 (13.0%) died. Machine learning models trained with laboratory or a combination of laboratory + clinical data achieved an area-under-the ROC curve of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80-0.84) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81-0.87) for predicting 31-day mortality, respectively. In the validation set, models outperformed internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores in sensitivity (92% vs. 72% vs. 78%;p<0.001,all comparisons) while retaining comparable specificity (78% vs. 74% vs. 72%;p>0.02). The model had higher diagnostic accuracy with an area-under-the-ROC curve of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.78-0.92) compared to abbMEDS (0.63,0.54-0.73), mREMS (0.63,0.54-0.72) and internal medicine physicians (0.74,0.65-0.82). Conclusion Machine learning models outperformed internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores in predicting 31-day mortality. These models are a promising tool to aid in risk stratification of patients presenting to the ED with sepsis.Copyright © 2021 van Doorn et al.

AB  - Objective: Having shown promise in other medical fields, we sought to determine whether machine learning (ML) models perform better than usual care in diagnostic and prognostic prediction for emergency department (ED) patients. Method(s): In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and CINAHL from inception to October 17, 2019. We included studies comparing diagnostic and prognostic prediction of ED patients by ML models to usual care methods (triage-based scores, clinical prediction tools, clinician judgment) using predictor variables readily available to ED clinicians. We extracted commonly reported performance metrics of model discrimination and classification. We used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020158129). Result(s): The search yielded 1,656 unique records, of which 23 studies involving 16,274,647 patients were included. In all seven diagnostic studies, ML models outperformed usual care in all performance metrics. In six studies assessing in-hospital mortality, the best-performing ML models had better discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] =0.74-0.94) than any clinical decision tool (AUROC =0.68-0.81). In four studies assessing hospitalization, ML models had better discrimination (AUROC =0.80-0.83) than triage-based scores (AUROC =0.68-0.82). Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Most studies had high risk of bias due to lack of external validation, low event rates, and insufficient reporting of calibration. Conclusion(s): Our review suggests that ML may have better prediction performance than usual care for ED patients with a variety of clinical presentations and outcomes. However, prediction model reporting guidelines should be followed to provide clinically applicable data. Interventional trials are needed to assess the impact of ML models on patient-centered outcomes.Copyright © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

AB  - Background: The early clinical course of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses driving presentation to hospital. However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. Method(s): We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. Finding(s): We assessed 155 689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114 957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115 394 patients, with 72 310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity (AUROC 0.940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >98.5%) across a range of prevalences (<=5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 92.3% accuracy (NPV 97.6%, AUROC 0.881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 92.5% accuracy (97.7%, 0.871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 95.1%, admissions model 94.1%) and NPV (ED model 99.0%, admissions model 98.5%). Interpretation(s): Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Nephrolithiasis is a chronic disease and stone recurrence rates can be reduced by implementing the AUA kidney stone medical management guidelines. It is recommended that clinicians should perform additional metabolic testing in high-risk or interested first-time stone formers and recurrent stone formers. This investigation assessed the ability of artificial intelligence to identify patients who are at high risk for symptomatic kidney stone recurrence and predict when a patient will recur. METHOD(S): A 10 year period (January 2008 to December 2018) retrospective review of electronic medical records of patients with diagnosis of kidney stones. We used machine learning and developed two models to identify symptomatic stone recurrence: 1. Which patients are at risk of symptomatic recurrence 2. When will these patients present with a symptomatic recurrence. Symptomatic stone recurrence was defined as any kidney stone encounter occurring more than 90 days after initial diagnosis that involved an Emergency Department visit, admission, or surgery. The algorithm was developed on patients with kidney stone diagnosis encounters. The algorithm was validated on members with kidney stones between January 2019 to June 2019. RESULT(S): A total of 108,000 patients were identified with the diagnosis of kidney stones. The algorithm was applied to 516,000 kidney stone encounters attributed to this cohort. The algorithm was validated on 1,123 patients with kidney stones between January 2019 to June 2019. The models consider 655 attributes that were identified through data analysis and clinician input. The models can predict which patients are at risk for symptomatic kidney stone recurrence with AUCROC = 0.83 (see Figure 1). The time to recurrence model prioritized patients within the high risk group. C-statistic value is 0.79. CONCLUSION(S): Artificial Intelligence can analyze large and complex data sets and improve clinicians ability to triage patients into low, moderate and high-risk groups. This will improve patient counseling and may improve quality of care by implementing preventive measures on high risk patients and reduce metabolic workup, invasive endoscopy and ionizing radiation exposure for low risk kidney stone patients.

AB  - Background: Computed tomography (CT)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) enables the noninvasive functional assessment of coronary artery stenosis. We evaluated the feasibility and potential clinical role of FFRCT in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain who underwent chest-pain CT (CPCT). Method(s): For this retrospective IRB-approved study, we included 56 patients (median age: 62 years, 14 females) with acute chest pain who underwent CPCT and who had at least a mild (>=25% diameter) coronary artery stenosis. CPCT was evaluated for the presence of acute plaque rupture and vulnerable plaque features. FFRCT measurements were performed using a machine learning-based software. We assessed the agreement between the results from FFRCT and patient outcome (including results from invasive catheter angiography and from any non-invasive cardiac imaging test, final clinical diagnosis and revascularization) for a follow-up of 3 months. Result(s): FFRCT was technically feasible in 38/56 patients (68%). Eleven of the 38 patients (29%) showed acute plaque rupture in CPCT; all of them underwent immediate coronary revascularization. Of the remaining 27 patients (71%), 16 patients showed vulnerable plaque features (59%), of whom 11 (69%) were diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 10 (63%) underwent coronary revascularization. In patients with vulnerable plaque features in CPCT, FFRCT had an agreement with outcome in 12/16 patients (75%). In patients without vulnerable plaque features (n=11), one patient showed myocardial ischemia (9%). In these patients, FFRCT and patient outcome showed an agreement in 10/11 patients (91%). Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that FFRCT is feasible in patients with acute chest pain who undergo CPCT provided that image quality is sufficient. FFRCT has the potential to improve patient triage by reducing further downstream testing but appears of limited value in patients with CT signs of acute plaque rupture.Copyright © Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In emergency medical services (EMSs), accurately predicting the severity of a patient's medical condition is important for the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk. In this study, we developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on deep learning to predict the need for critical care during EMS. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective observation cohort study. The algorithm was established using development data from the Korean national emergency department information system, which were collected during visits in real time from 151 emergency departments (EDs). We validated the algorithm using EMS run sheets from two EDs. The study subjects comprised adult patients who visited EDs. The endpoint was critical care, and we used age, sex, chief complaint, symptom onset to arrival time, trauma, and initial vital signs as the predicted variables. RESULT(S): The number of patients in the development data was 8,981,181, and the validation data comprised 2604 EMS run sheets from two hospitals. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the algorithm to predict the critical care was 0.867 (95% confidence interval, [0.864-0.871]). This result outperformed the Emergency Severity Index (0.839 [0.831-0.846]), Korean Triage and Acuity System (0.824 [0.815-0.832]), National Early Warning Score (0.741 [0.734-0.748]), and Modified Early Warning Score (0.696 [0.691-0.699]). CONCLUSION(S): The AI algorithm accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients using information during EMS and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores.

AB  - Objective: Emergency departments (EDs) continue to pursue optimal patient flow without sacrificing quality of care. The speed with which a healthcare provider receives pertinent information, such as results from clinical orders, can impact flow. We seek to determine if clinical ordering behavior can be predicted at triage during an ED visit. Material(s) and Method(s): Using data available during triage, we trained multilabel machine learning classifiers to predict clinical orders placed during an ED visit. We benchmarked 4 classifiers with 2 multilabel learning frameworks that predict orders independently (binary relevance) or simultaneously (random k-labelsets). We evaluated algorithm performance, calculated variable importance, and conducted a simple simulation study to examine the effects of algorithm implementation on length of stay and cost. Result(s): Aggregate performance across orders was highest when predicting orders independently with a multilayer perceptron (median F1 score = 0.56), but prediction frameworks that simultaneously predict orders for a visit enhanced predictive performance for correlated orders. Visit acuity was the most important predictor for most orders. Simulation results indicated that direct implementation of the model would increase ordering costs (from $21 to $45 per visit) but reduce length of stay (from 158 minutes to 151 minutes) over all visits. Discussion(s): Simulated implementations of the predictive algorithm decreased length of stay but increased ordering costs. Optimal implementation of these predictions to reduce patient length of stay without incurring additional costs requires more exploration. Conclusion(s): It is possible to predict common clinical orders placed during an ED visit with data available at triage.Copyright © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association 2019.

AB  - The amplification of viral RNA by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test is the current gold standard for the confirmation of an infection from coronavirus (COVID-19), the worldwide pandemic that, in the first eight months post-outbreak, has caused almost 730.000 deaths. However, this test presents known limits, such as a long turnaround time, false-negative rates as high as 15-20%, expensive equipment, and a lack of trained personnel. Thus, there is a need for alternative, faster, cheaper, and more accessible tests. We developed a number of machine learning (ML) classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) based on the routine complete blood count (CBC) data, from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive) on admission to the Emergency Department (ED) at the San Raffaele Hospital (OSR) from February 19, to May 31, 2020. This dataset is composed by 21 features including age, gender, suffering from COVID specific symptoms at triage, COVID-19 positivity, and CBC data. The ML models were trained using a training set comprising 80% of the cases (after model selection and hyperparameter optimization) and were evaluated on a test set comprising the remaining cases (20% of the cases). An external dataset (from 58 patients admitted at the ED of the Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi of Milan, March 5-May 26, 2020) and an internal dataset (data from 54 patients randomly chosen admitted in OSR in 2018), were used for the validation. All models showed a reported accuracy that is consistently higher than 85%. They achieved good performances in symptomatic patients (with both the sensitivity and specificity at approximately 80%) and performed even better in terms of specificity in asymptomatic patients (100% specificity), although the sensitivity was as low as 50%. Our study demonstrates that ML can be applied to CBC as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients. This is especially useful in developing countries, or in countries facing an extraordinary increase in contagions, as they can suffer from shortages of rRTPCR reagents and specialized laboratories.

AB  - Study Objective: To test the performance of a recently FDA-cleared machine learning method (Claritgamma) that generates bedside alerts for possible status epilepticus and measures in real time the burden of seizure activity. Method(s): We designed a retrospective study of electroencephalographs from adult patients (n=353) who underwent monitoring with Rapid Response EEG system (Rapid-EEG, Ceribell Inc.) for evaluation of possible seizures between January 2018 and April 2019. We developed a machine learning method for automated detection of seizure activity and seizure burden throughout each recording. We measured sensitivity and specificity of possible status epilepticus (seizures>5 minutes) and real-time seizure burden measurements generated by Claritgamma compared to the majority consensus of at least 2 expert neurologists reviewing the same EEGs. Various thresholds of seizure burden were tested (>=10% indicating at least 30 seconds seizure activity in the last 5 minutes, >=50% indicating at least 2.5 minutes of seizure activity, and >=90% indicating at least 4.5 minutes of seizure activity and triggering an alert for status epilepticus). Result(s): Majority consensus of neurologists labeled the 353 EEGs as normal or slow activity (n=249), highly epileptiform patterns (HEP, n=87), or seizures (N=17, nine longer than five minutes and eight shorter than five minutes). The sensitivity and specificity of various thresholds for seizure burden during EEG recordings for detecting patients with seizures was 100% and 82% for 50% seizure burden and 88% and 60% for 10% seizure burden. The algorithm generated a status epilepticus alert (>=90% seizure burden) with 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Of the 179 EEG recordings in which the algorithm detected no seizures, seizures were identified by the expert reviewers in only 2 cases, indicating a negative predictive value of 99%. Conclusion(s): Combination of high sensitivity for status epilepticus events combined with a high negative predictive value for negative cases makes our novel algorithm a useful tool for triaging EEGs in emergency care settings. Confirming cases of non-convulsive subclinical status epilepticus cases within minutes of their arrival to emergency department and independently from neurologists and or EEG technicians will expedite the triage of these critically ill patients and will expedite their treatment. In addition, ruling out seizures accurately in cases being suspected to have seizures can help prevent unnecessary or aggressive over-treatment of such patients.Copyright © 2020

AB  - Objective: Machine learning (ML) can process complex nonlinear relationships between predictors. ML has had superior outcome predictions in a variety of settings including emergency department triage and pediatric traumatic brain injury. Our goal was to examine the utility of ML models for predicting risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Method(s): An ML model to predict the presence of AAA (>3 cm) was created from the database of a national nonprofit screening organization (AAAneurysm Outreach). Participants self-reported demographics and comorbidities. The model is a two-layered feed-forward shallow network. Sensitivity analysis for each input parameter was performed to identify which parameters had the most influence on the algorithm. The ML model then generated AAA probability based on patients' characteristics. Result(s): A cohort of 10,329 patients with an AAA prevalence of 2.70% was analyzed. Consistent with logistic regression analysis, the ML model identified the following predictors of AAA: white ethnicity, male sex, increasing age, and recent or past smoker with recent smoker having a more profound effect (P <.05). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the most important parameters to the model were hypertension, smoking, and family history of AAA. Interestingly, the ML model showed that body mass index (BMI) was associated with likelihood of AAA. On re-evaluation of the data, this was seen for white male nonsmokers aged 50 to 65 years with a BMI >25 kg/m2 (P <.5) as well as for smokers. The opposite was true for older, white, nonobese male smokers-there was an increased prevalence of AAA in comparison to overweight smokers (P <.01). These relationships together with the ML model for a BMI of 25 kg/m2 are shown in the Fig. This reverse effect of BMI on AAA prevalence with older compared with middle-aged patients was also seen in women and male never smokers. Conclusion(s): We have successfully developed an ML model based on an AAA screening database. This has unveiled a complex relationship of AAA prevalence with BMI. Furthermore, this ML model has the potential to be transitioned to a clinical setting to deliver more precise screening recommendations. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020

AB  - Purpose: In this study, we aimed to develop a novel prediction model to identify patients in need of a non-contrast head CT exam during emergency department (ED) triage. Method(s): We collected data of all adult ED visits in our institution for five consecutive years (1/2013-12/2017). Retrieved variables included the following: demographics, mode of arrival to the ED, comorbidities, home medications, structured and unstructured chief complaints, vital signs, pain scale score, emergency severity index, ED wing assignment, documentation of previous ED visits, hospitalizations and CTs, and current visit non-contrast head CT usage. A machine learning gradient boosting model was trained on data from the years 2013-2016 and tested on data from 2017. Area under the curve (AUC) was used as metrics. Single-variable AUCs were also determined. Youden's index evaluated optimal sensitivity and specificity of the models. Result(s): The final cohort included 595,561 ED visits. Non-contrast head CT usage rate was 11.8%. Each visit was coded into an input vector of 171 variables. Single-variable analysis showed that chief complaint had the best single predictive analysis (AUC = 0.87). The best model showed an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.931-0.936) for predicting non-contrast head CT usage at triage level. The model had a sensitivity of 88.1% and specificity of 85.7% for non-contrast head CT utilization. Conclusion(s): The developed model can identify patients that need to undergo head CT exam already in the ED triage level and by that allow faster diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Early identification of high-risk septic patients in the emergency department (ED) may guide appropriate management and disposition, thereby improving outcomes. We compared the performance of machine learning models against conventional risk stratification tools, namely the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and our previously described Singapore ED Sepsis (SEDS) model, in the prediction of 30-day in-hospital mortality (IHM) among suspected sepsis patients in the ED.Adult patients who presented to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) ED between September 2014 and April 2016, and who met >=2 of the 4 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria were included. Patient demographics, vital signs and heart rate variability (HRV) measures obtained at triage were used as predictors. Baseline models were created using qSOFA, NEWS, MEWS, and SEDS scores. Candidate models were trained using k-nearest neighbors, random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting and support vector machine. Models were evaluated on F1 score and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).A total of 214 patients were included, of whom 40 (18.7%) met the outcome. Gradient boosting was the best model with a F1 score of 0.50 and AUPRC of 0.35, and performed better than all the baseline comparators (SEDS, F1 0.40, AUPRC 0.22; qSOFA, F1 0.32, AUPRC 0.21; NEWS, F1 0.38, AUPRC 0.28; MEWS, F1 0.30, AUPRC 0.25).A machine learning model can be used to improve prediction of 30-day IHM among suspected sepsis patients in the ED compared to traditional risk stratification tools.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To further develop and refine an Emergency Department (ED) in-patient admission prediction model using machine learning techniques. Method(s): This was a retrospective analysis of state-wide ED data from New South Wales, Australia. Six classification algorithms (Bayesian networks, decision trees, logistic regression, naive Bayes, neural networks and nearest neighbour) and five feature selection techniques (none, manual, correlation-based, information gain and wrapper) were examined. Presenting problem was categorised using broad (n = 20) and specific (n = 100) representations. Models were evaluated based on Area Under the Curve (AUC) and accuracy. The results were compared with the Sydney Triage to Admission Risk Tool (START), which uses logistic regression and six manually selected features. Result(s): Sixty admission prediction models were trained and validated using data from 1 721 294 patients. Under the broad representation of presenting problem, the nearest neighbour algorithm with manual feature selection had the best AUC of 0.8206 (95% CI +/-0.0006), while the decision tree with no feature selection had the best accuracy of 74.83% (95% CI +/-0.065). Under the specific representation, almost all models improved; the nearest neighbour with information gain feature selection had the best AUC of 0.8267 (95% CI +/-0.0006), while the decision tree with wrapper or no feature selection had the best accuracy of 75.24% (95% CI +/-0.064). Eleven of the machine learning models had slightly better AUC than the START model. Conclusion(s): Machine learning methods demonstrate similar performance to logistic regression for ED disposition prediction models using basic triage information. This should be investigated further, especially for larger data sets with more complex clinical information.Copyright © 2018 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine

AB  - Introduction: Emergency nurses triage nearly 137 million patients every year. Chest pain is a common complaint at the emergency department but it frequently lacks specificity, which makes the recognition of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) a very challenging and tedious task. In fact, nurses' accuracy in recognizing ACS at triage is only 45%. We tested whether machine learning models could identify chest pain patients at greatest risk for adverse cardiac events using patient features available at the time of nurse triage. Method(s): We used already-existing data from EMPIRE study, which is a prospective observational cohort study that enrolled patients with prehospital chest pain transported to three tertiary care hospitals in the U.S. Independent reviewers extracted 30 patient factors available at nurse triage from hospital electronic health records: demographics, past medical history, initial vital signs, symptomatology, and automated interpretation of 12-lead ECG. The primary outcome was 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as: ACS, coronary revascularization, pulmonary embolus, fatal ventricular arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest or all-cause death. We tested and validated the performance of three machine leaning algorithms to predict the study outcome: logistic regression machine, classification tree, and random forest classifiers. Algorithm training was done using 10-fold cross-validation methods on 60% of the sample, and we then used the remaining 40% as a testing set. We computed the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the best model. Result(s): The sample included 750 patients (age 59+/-17; 42% females, 40% Black). Overall, there was a total of 145 (19%) MACE events of which 90% occurred during the indexed admission. Using the 30 patient factors that were available at triage, the best classification performance on the testing test was obtained using the logistic regression machine model (AUROC = 0.72, F1 score = 0.63, accuracy = 0.79 [0.73-0.84]). Conclusion(s): Predictive machine learning modeling can improve nurses' accuracy in triaging high-risk chest pain patients by nearly 35%. Future work can test model performance in prospective patients with undifferentiated chest pain.

AB  - Objective To predict hospital admission at the time of ED triage using patient history in addition to information collected at triage. Methods This retrospective study included all adult ED visits between March 2014 and July 2017 from one academic and two community emergency rooms that resulted in either admission or discharge. A total of 972 variables were extracted per patient visit. Samples were randomly partitioned into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. We trained a series of nine binary classifiers using logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural networks (DNN) on three dataset types: one using only triage information, one using only patient history, and one using the full set of variables. Next, we tested the potential benefit of additional training samples by training models on increasing fractions of our data. Lastly, variables of importance were identified using information gain as a metric to create a low-dimensional model. Results A total of 560,486 patient visits were included in the study, with an overall admission risk of 29.7%. Models trained on triage information yielded a test AUC of 0.87 for LR (95% CI 0.86-0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.87-0.88) and 0.87 for DNN (95% CI 0.87-0.88). Models trained on patient history yielded an AUC of 0.86 for LR (95% CI 0.86-0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.87-0.87) and 0.87 for DNN (95% CI 0.87-0.88). Models trained on the full set of variables yielded an AUC of 0.91 for LR (95% CI 0.91-0.91), 0.92 for XGBoost (95% CI 0.92-0.93) and 0.92 for DNN (95% CI 0.92-0.92). All algorithms reached maximum performance at 50% of the training set or less. A low-dimensional XGBoost model built on ESI level, outpatient medication counts, demographics, and hospital usage statistics yielded an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.91-0.91). Conclusion Machine learning can robustly predict hospital admission using triage information and patient history. The addition of historical information improves predictive performance significantly compared to using triage information alone, highlighting the need to incorporate these variables into prediction models.Copyright © 2018 Hong et al.

AB  - Purpose: Pediatric asthma is a leading cause of emergency department (ED) utilization and hospitalization. Several asthma severity scores predict admission several hours into the ED stay. Earlier identification of need for hospital level care could triage patients more efficiently to high- or low-resource ED tracks. In addition to the rich clinical data available in the electronic health record (EHR), geographic location can also be leveraged to access epidemiologic, weather, and socio-demographic (e.g. neighborhood) data. Our objective was to use a machine-learning approach to build and validate various models to predict need for hospital level care in pediatric patients presenting with asthma exacerbation at the time of ED triage. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of patients ages 2-18 years seen at two urban pediatric EDs with asthma exacerbation between 1/2010 and 12/2016. We included patients who received both albuterol and systemic corticosteroids. We included patient features (gender, race/ethnicity, age, weight), measures of illness severity available in triage (oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and triage acuity), weather features (rolling averages over 1, 2, 7 and 14 days prior to presentation), CDC influenza patterns, and socio-demographic features based on patient zip code (poverty, housing type, and occupancy) in the models. We tested four different models: decision trees, logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. For each model, 80% of the data was used for training and 20% was used to evaluate the models. The area under (AUC) the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e. discrimination) was calculated for each model. Result(s): There were 29,354 patients included in the analyses; mean age of 7.0 years (SD 4.3), 42% female, 77% non-Hispanic black, 76% public insurance. The AUCs for each model were decision tree 0.68 (95%CL 0.65-0.75), logistic regression 0.82 (95% CL 0.81-0.82), random forests 0.82 (95% CL 0.81-0.83), and gradient boosting machines 0.85 (95% CL 0.84-0.8). Figure 1 shows the AUC curves for each model. In the lowest quintile of risk, only 1% of patients required hospitalization; in the highest quintile this rate was 54%. After patient vital signs and acuity information, weather-related features were the most important for predicting asthma admission. (Figure 2) Conclusion(s): The gradient boosting machines model was the most successful at predicting need for hospital level care at the time of triage in pediatric patients presenting with asthma exacerbation. The addition of weather data significantly improved the performance of this model. These models could be used for differential triage of low-risk patients and high-risk patients as a strategy to improve efficiency.

AB  - Objective: The identification of stroke-associated biomarkers represents a means by which prehospital triage could be expedited to increase the probability of successful intervention. Thus, the objective of this work was to use high-throughput transcriptomics in combination with basic machine learning techniques to identify a pattern of gene expression in peripheral whole blood which could be used to identify acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the acute care setting. Method(s): A two-stage study design was used which included a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort. In the discovery cohort, peripheral whole blood samples were obtained from 39 AIS patients upon emergency department admission, and from 24 neurologically asymptomatic controls. Microarray was used to measure the expression of over 22,000 genes and a pattern recognition technique known as genetic algorithm k-nearest neighbors (GA/kNN) identified a pattern of gene expression that optimally discriminated between AIS and controls. In an independent validation cohort, the gene expression pattern was tested for its ability to discriminate between 39 AIS patients and each of two different control groups, one consisting of 30 neurologically asymptomatic controls, and the other consisting of 15 stroke mimics, with gene expression levels being assessed by qRT-PCR. Result(s): In the discovery cohort, GA/kNN identified ten transcripts (ANTXR2, STK3, PDK4, CD163, MAL, GRAP, ID3, CTSZ, KIF1B, and PLXDC2) whose coordinate pattern of expression correctly identified 98.4% of subjects (97.4% sensitive, 100% specific). In the validation cohort, the same 10 transcripts correctly identified 95.6% of subjects when comparing AIS patients to asymptomatic controls (92.3% sensitive, 100% specific), and 96.3% of subjects when comparing AIS patients to stroke mimics (97.4% specific, 93.3% sensitive). Conclusion(s): These results demonstrate that a highly accurate RNA-based companion diagnostic for AIS is plausible using a relatively small number of markers. The pattern of gene expression identified in this study shows strong diagnostic potential, and warrants further evaluation to determine true clinical efficacy.

AB  - Background: Multiple studies have identified inpatient bed availability as a key metric for Emergency Department operational performance. Early planning for patient admissions may allow for optimization of hospital resources. Objective(s): Our study aimed to predict the need for admission at the time of patient triage utilizing data already available in the electronic health record (EHR). We performed a retrospective analysis of EHR derived data to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting the likelihood of admission for patient encounters in an academic emergency department. We hypothesized that more comprehensive & inclusive models would provide greater predictive power. Method(s): All patients who presented from 1/1/2012 to 12/31/2013 and met inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. The data were then partitioned into two sets for training and testing. The primary outcome measured was the ability of the trained models to discern the future admission status of an encounter, measured in terms of area under the receiver operator curve (ROC AUC). A secondary outcome was accuracy (ACC). Model features included a mix of patient specific factors (demographics, triage vital signs, visit and chief complaint history), the state of the ED (census and other performance metrics); and timing factors (time of day, etc.). The most comprehensive models included 682 variables, encoding 328 features, aggregated into 3 feature groups. Result(s): Our final analysis included 91,060 patient encounters. 28,838 (31.7%) of these encounters resulted in an inpatient admission. Compared to using a naive model, single feature group models provided improved predictive abilities (1.8% - 50.8% improvement in ROC AUC), see figure for details. More sophisticated models, including all available feature groups provided greater predictive power with the greatest achieved at ROC AUC score of 0.756. Conclusion(s): We have demonstrated that including information about incoming patients and the state of the ED at the time of an triage can aid in the prediction of individual patients' likelihood of admission. More sophisticated models using claims, weather, and social media data may lead to greater predictive power to prospectively estimate patient admission likelihood at arrival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The key aim of triage in chest pain patients is to identify those with high risk of adverse cardiac events as they require intensive monitoring and early intervention. In this study, we aim to discover the most relevant variables for risk prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) using clinical signs and heart rate variability., METHODS: A total of 702 chest pain patients at the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary hospital in Singapore were included in this study. The recruited patients were at least 30 years of age and who presented to the ED with a primary complaint of non-traumatic chest pain. The primary outcome was a composite of MACE such as death and cardiac arrest within 72 h of arrival at the ED. For each patient, eight clinical signs such as blood pressure and temperature were measured, and a 5-min ECG was recorded to derive heart rate variability parameters. A random forest-based novel method was developed to select the most relevant variables. A geometric distance-based machine learning scoring system was then implemented to derive a risk score from 0 to 100., RESULTS: Out of 702 patients, 29 (4.1%) met the primary outcome. We selected the 3 most relevant variables for predicting MACE, which were systolic blood pressure, the mean RR interval and the mean instantaneous heart rate. The scoring system with these 3 variables produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.812, and a cutoff score of 43 gave a sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 63.4%, while the scoring system with all the 23 variables had an AUC of 0.736, and a cutoff score of 49 gave a sensitivity of 72.4% and specificity of 63.0%. Conventional thrombolysis in myocardial infarction score and the modified early warning score achieved AUC values of 0.637 and 0.622, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: It is observed that a few predictors outperformed the whole set of variables in predicting MACE within 72 h. We conclude that more predictors do not necessarily guarantee better prediction results. Furthermore, machine learning-based variable selection seems promising in discovering a few relevant and significant measures as predictors.

AB  - Introduction: A key aim of triage is to identify those with high risk of cardiac arrest, as they require intensive monitoring, resuscitation facilities, and early intervention. We aim to validate a novel machine learning (ML) score incorporating heart rate variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS). Method(s): We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients (Patient Acuity Category Scale 1 and 2) in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5-minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death. Result(s): From June 2006 to June 2008 we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781, compared with 0.680 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.101, 95% confidence interval: 0.006 to 0.197). As for in-hospital death, the area under the curve for ML score is 0.741, compared with 0.693 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.048, 95% confidence interval: -0.023 to 0.119). A cutoff ML score >= 60 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 84.1%, specificity of 72.3% and negative predictive value of 98.8%. A cutoff MEWS >= 3 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 74.4%, specificity of 54.2% and negative predictive value of 97.8%. Conclusion(s): We found ML scores to be more accurate than the MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours. There is potential to develop bedside devices for risk stratification based on cardiac arrest prediction. © 2012 Ong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - : Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is the future that is already here. Despite its potential as a transformational force for primary care, most primary care providers (PCPs) do not know what it is, how it will impact them and their patients, and what its key limitations and ethical pitfalls are. This article is a beginner's guide to health care AI, written for the frontline PCP. Primary care-as the dominant force at the base of the health care pyramid, with its unrivaled interconnectedness to every part of the health system and its deep relationship with patients and communities-is the most uniquely suited specialty to lead the health care AI revolution. PCPs can advance health care AI by partnering with technologists to ensure that AI use cases are relevant and human-centered, applying quality improvement methods to health care AI implementations, and advocating for inclusive and ethical AI that combats, rather than worsens, health inequities., Copyright (C) 2022 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

AB  - Purpose of review: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are global public health problems associated with a significant burden of morbidity, healthcare resource use, and all-cause mortality. This review explores recently published studies that take a machine learning approach to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication in patients with AKI or CKD., Recent findings: The release of novel therapeutics for CKD has highlighted the importance of accurately identifying patients at the highest risk of progression. Many models have been constructed with reasonable predictive accuracy but have not been extensively externally validated and peer reviewed. Similarly, machine learning models have been developed for prediction of AKI and have found sufficient accuracy. There are issues to implementing these models, however, with conflicting results with respect to the relationship between prediction of an AKI outcome and improvements in the occurrence of other adverse events, and in some circumstances potential harm., Summary: Artificial intelligence models can help guide management of CKD and AKI, but it is important to ensure that they are broadly applicable and generalizable to various settings and associated with improved clinical decision-making and outcomes., Copyright (C) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Physicians continuously make tough decisions when discharging patients. Alerting on poor outcomes may help in this decision. This study evaluates a machine learning model for predicting 30-day mortality in emergency department (ED) discharged patients., Methods: We retrospectively analysed visits of adult patients discharged from a single ED (1/2014-12/2018). Data included demographics, evaluation and treatment in the ED, and discharge diagnosis. The data comprised of both structured and free-text fields. A gradient boosting model was trained to predict mortality within 30 days of release from the ED. The model was trained on data from the years 2014-2017 and validated on data from the year 2018. In order to reduce potential end-of-life bias, a subgroup analysis was performed for non-oncological patients., Results: Overall, 363 635 ED visits of discharged patients were analysed. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.8%. A majority of the mortality cases (65.3%) had a known oncological disease. The model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.97) for predicting 30-day mortality. For a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 0.81 to 0.86), this model had a false positive rate of 1:20. For patients without a known malignancy, the model yielded an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.95)., Conclusions: Although not frequent, patients may die following ED discharge. Machine learning-based tools may help ED physicians identify patients at risk. An optimised decision for hospitalisation or palliative management may improve patient care and system resource allocation., (C) 2022 The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine

AB  - Purpose/Aims: Despite advances in healthcare, the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) has continued to rise for the past decade. Identifying those patients at risk has proven challenging. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to compare the IHCA predictive performance of machine learning (ML) models with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS)., Design: The systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines and registered on PROSPERO CRD42020182357., Method: Data extraction was completed using the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies checklist. The risk of bias and applicability were evaluated using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool., Results: Nine articles were included in this review that developed or validated IHCA prediction models and compared them with the MEWS. The studies by Jang et al and Kim et al showed that their ML models outperformed MEWS to predict IHCA with good to excellent predictive performance., Conclusions: The ML models presented in this systematic review demonstrate a novel approach to predicting IHCA. All included studies suggest that ML models had similar or better predictive performance compared with MEWS. However, there is substantial variability in performance measures and concerns for risk of bias., Copyright (C) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved

AB  - Objectives: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are commonly performed in emergency units (EUs), but the interpretation requires radiology experience. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system (precommercial) that aims to mimic board-certified radiologists' (BCRs') performance and can therefore support non-radiology residents (NRRs) in clinical settings lacking 24/7 radiology coverage. We validated by quantifying the clinical value of our AI system for radiology residents (RRs) and EU-experienced NRRs in a clinically representative EU setting., Materials and Methods: A total of 563 EU CXRs were retrospectively assessed by 3 BCRs, 3 RRs, and 3 EU-experienced NRRs. Suspected pathologies (pleural effusion, pneumothorax, consolidations suspicious for pneumonia, lung lesions) were reported on a 5-step confidence scale (sum of 20,268 reported pathology suspicions [563 images x 9 readers x 4 pathologies]) separately by every involved reader. Board-certified radiologists' confidence scores were converted into 4 binary reference standards (RFSs) of different sensitivities. The RRs' and NRRs' performances were statistically compared with our AI system (trained on nonpublic data from different clinical sites) based on receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) and operating point metrics approximated to the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity (Youden statistics)., Results: The NRRs lose diagnostic accuracy to RRs with increasingly sensitive BCRs' RFSs for all considered pathologies. Based on our external validation data set, the AI system/NRRs' consensus mimicked the most sensitive BCRs' RFSs with areas under ROC of 0.940/0.837 (pneumothorax), 0.953/0.823 (pleural effusion), and 0.883/0.747 (lung lesions), which were comparable to experienced RRs and significantly overcomes EU-experienced NRRs' diagnostic performance. For consolidation detection, the AI system performed on the NRRs' consensus level (and overcomes each individual NRR) with an area under ROC of 0.847 referenced to the BCRs' most sensitive RFS., Conclusions: Our AI system matched RRs' performance, meanwhile significantly outperformed NRRs' diagnostic accuracy for most of considered CXR pathologies (pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and lung lesions) and therefore might serve as clinical decision support for NRRs., Copyright (C) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Free-text information is still widely used in emergency department (ED) records. Machine learning techniques are useful for analyzing narratives, but they have been used mostly for English-language data sets. Considering such a framework, the performance of an ML classification task of a Spanish-language ED visits database was tested. ED visits collected in the EDs of nine hospitals in Nicaragua were analyzed. Spanish-language, free-text discharge diagnoses were considered in the analysis. Five-hundred random forests were trained on a set of bootstrap samples of the whole data set (1,789 ED visits) to perform the classification task. For each one, after having identified optimal parameter value, the final validated model was trained on the whole bootstrapped data set and tested. The classification accuracies had a median of 0.783 (95% CI [0.779, 0.796]). Machine learning techniques seemed to be a promising opportunity for the exploitation of unstructured information reported in ED records in low- and middle-income Spanish-speaking countries., (C)2021Sage Publications

AB  - Current experience suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) may be useful in the management of hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19. In light of the challenges faced with diagnostic and prognostic indicators in SARS-CoV-2 infection, our center has developed an international clinical protocol to collect standardized thoracic point of care ultrasound data in these patients for later AI/ML modeling. We surmise that in the future AI/ML may assist in the management of SARS-CoV-2 patients potentially leading to improved outcomes, and to that end, a corpus of curated ultrasound images and linked patient clinical metadata is an invaluable research resource., (C)2021Sage Publications
