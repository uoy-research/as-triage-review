	<h1>Autonomous Systems in Triage</h1>
	<p> We present here the information obtained during the systematic literature review of autonomous systems in emergency medicine, specifically in the domain of accident and emergency (A&E) of hospitals.</p>

	<p> This systematic review was born out of initial review by Billy Lyons of the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Node in Resilience at the University of York (add link here) for the DAISY project. In consultation with Dr Ol'Tunde Ashoalu and the rest of the DAISY team, we identified that the breadth of the triage process lead to many papers approaching different areas of the problem, and that identification of stages of the triage process could lead to greater comparability and collaboration in the area of autonomous systems for emergency medicine.</p>

	<h2 id="stage_identification_header"> Stage Identification </h2>
		<p> In the course of discussion of the triage process we identified 5 key stage (1-5), and a zeroth stage, these are outlined in the figure below. </p>

		<p>This is of course a simplified abstraction of the process as, at each stage, additional procedures, investigations or treatments that are situation, patient or institution dependent may occur; however, we do believe this is a useful abstraction in the context of autonomous systems in the context of emergency medicine.</p>

		<ul>
			<li> Stage 0: Provision of information and social interaction;</li>
			<li> Stage 1: Collating low level subjective data and zeroth level triage;</li>
			<li> Stage 2: Collating more specific subjective data and primary triage;</li>
			<li> Stage 3: Collating objective data and secondary triage;</li>
			<li> Stage 4: Interpret and analyse collected data, approve additional investigations;</li>
			<li> Stage 5: Examination and assessment of patient, diagnose, treat, dispose.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2 id="search_terms"> Search Terms and Inclusion-Exclusion (IE) Criteria </h2>
		<p>To determine the inclusion exclusion criteria, we must describe the research questions we have in the </p>
		<h3> Research questions </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> What stage(s) of the triage process are covered by the paper?</li>
			<li> Which technologies, methods or interventions are employed in the paper?</li>
			<li> What type of data, and how many samples are used?</li>
			<li> Is the deployment in regular use?</li>
			<li> Is the deployment patient facing?</li>
			<li> Is the deployment for general triage, or focused to a specific malady?</li>
